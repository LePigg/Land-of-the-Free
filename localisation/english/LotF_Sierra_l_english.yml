srr.1.t:0 "A Shield of Hellfire"
srr.1.d:0 "With the sudden military coup by the Federalist Movement overthrowing President Norman Thomas, the country’s instability soon turned into an all out civil war. In response to socialist forces mobilizing in the north and west coast, the Western Defence Command was established by the Federalists in the Rockies and Great Plains region. With the subsequent formation of the Cascadian Provisional State, the WDC began an invasion into the West Coast against the CMP’s Socialist West Coast Revolutionary Army, consisting of California and a rebellious Seattle. DeWitt dispatched an expeditionary force led by James Doolittle to launch an invasion into California. Alongside support of the air force, Doolittle conducted strategic bombing runs over California, as well as leading Federal Forces to victory in the Mojave Desert. Soon, the combined efforts of the force alongside Cascadia caused the collapse of Socialist California, but this was not the end. The socialists launched a Guerilla War campaign across the entire Western United States, conducting partisan attacks against Federal and Cascadian troops. DeWitt began to fear the possibility of socialist forces overthrowing his regime, and ordered a brutal crackdown on the civilian population. Thousands were convicted of being traitors to the nation and subsequently jailed or executed. The Federalists already had distrust in the eyes of the pro-democracy population, but this was the breaking point for them. Mass mutinies began in the name of protecting democracy from the WDC, and many states began to revolt against DeWitt. A revolution in Deseret and Arizona caused DeWitt to have to order an evacuation into the mountains, to which Doolittle’s expedition was not informed of. The revolts cut off Doolittle from supply and communications as well as granting the Socialists to build up force to begin a second assault on the force. Horribly overstretched, Doolittle ordered a retreat into the northern mountains of California, abandoning the Mojave to bandits. Within there, the socialists tried several attempts to take their new capital of Carson City, but failed. To secure their weak grip, general Curtis LeMay suggested a strategic bombing campaign of all of California in order to pacify the neighboring warlords. This act against American citizens was greatly criticized, but it seemed there was no other choice. For now, the sounds of planes and bombs echo throughout all of California."
srr.1.a:0 "Our survival must be ensured"
srr.2.t:0 "The Plan in Motion"
srr.2.d:0 "While anyone would be hard pressed to find a reason to complain about not having to bomb civilians, many of our pilots do not seem too fond of risking life and limb to do what many consider 'nothing more then delivering the sunday paper' to our enemies. Despite the opposition within the military however, this change has been warmly received by many of our citizens; and with a little luck maybe even the rest of California."
srr.2.a:0 "Here's to a safe trip home"
srr.3.t:0 "A Change in Heart?"
srr.3.d:0 "It is not too uncommon to see bombers in our skys. As a desperate measure of survival, the Federalist forces have conducted a campaign of destruction all across the SoCal area. Resulting in the deaths of thousands and the destruction of many homes and businesses. And today it seemed no different; as multiple squadrons of bombers roared overhead, many rushed to cover to protect themselves for the oncoming onslaught. But as they waited for the inevitable, nothing seemed to happen; no sounds of explosions, nor cries of the injured, just the wail of air-raid sirens and the ever quieting engines of airplanes. As people began to shuffle confusedly outside, the true nature as to the bombers appearance became apparent; all across the streets, and still fluttering throughout the air, were tens, perhaps hundreds, of thousands of paper pamphlets and pictures; on these pamphlets were various propaganda pictures decrying our current government and its inability to properly bring law and order, or apologies from the high command of the Federalist Forces, promising that their bombing campaign will be ended permanently. While many see this sudden turn-face as nothing more then empty promises, it can not be ignoredthat some among us have actually started to believe their propaganda. And although the respite from the bombs are welcomed, there is no possibility that the Federals are truly remorseful, right?"
srr.3.a:0 "A Blessing-"
srr.3.b:0 "Or a Curse in Disguise?"
srr.4.t:0 "The Bombs Keep Falling"
srr.4.d:0 "With the continued assaults of the Federal bombers, our nation is beginning to crack under the pressure. Cities are in a constant state of ruined, civilians are dying, and there's nothing we can do about it. It appears the only end to this nightmare would be the end of the Californian Federals would be war, but it might be a war we might not be capable to win."
srr.4.a:0 "We must slay these tyrants!"
srr.5.t:0 "The Sierra Army Reunifies California"
srr.5.d:0 "News has come in that the supposedly failed Federal expedition into California has made a surprise victory in the region. Their use of terror bombing and the crimes of the entire Federalist Movement have been catastrophic for the Federalist’s image, but their new commanding officer James DooLittle has promised to reform the movement in the eyes of the people, restoring some rights and slowly pulling back military influence. Could this be the Federalist’s redemption?"
srr.5.a:0 "Is heavy handed democracy really a democracy?"
srr.6.t:0 "The Sierra Army Reunifies California"
srr.6.d:0 "News has come in that the supposedly failed Federal expedition into California has made a surprise victory in the region. Their use of terror bombing and the crimes of the entire Federalist have been catastrophic for the Federalist’s image, but it appears their new commanding officer Curtis LeMay has decided to double down on the brutality, believing these cruel actions are needed in order to secure the Federal grip. His policy of “bombing traitors to the stone age” and brutal civilian crackdowns have shocked many in a regime somehow more cruel than the Western Defence Command. It appears that there is no room for compromise."
srr.6.a:0 "This can’t be good."
srr.7.t:0 "A offer from the Federalists"
srr.7.d:0 "In a suprising twist the Sierra Route Army seems to be willing to compromise with us; 'In order to prevent the unnessicary loss of American live, we hereby grant full amnesty to those accused of treason against the United States, on the condition of full capitulation and cooperation against any reamining enemies of the United States.' Definitely not an offer given to many; we must consider our next moves carefully, lest we destroy any chance of our own survival."
srr.7.a:0 "We're not so different as we thought, only good can come of cooperation."
srr.7.b:0 "Death is always preferable to survitude!"
srr.8.t:0 "Sacremento Accepts"
srr.8.d:0 "It seems that Hiram Johnson has seen reason, and has accepted our offer."
srr.8.a:0 "One more step to unity"
srr.9.t:0 "Sacremento Declines"
srr.9.d:0 "It seems that Hiram Johnson has decided to stand his groun and refuse our offer. With our envoy detained and all communication fully cut of, we now have no choice but war."
srr.9.a:0 "Down with the traitors..."
srr.10.t:0 "The Art of the Deal"
srr.10.d:0 "Being the man that he is Rossi could never be content to just take what he has and just be happy. But he is a man of many connections; with some consessions to autonomy, and gaining control (albeit only political) of San Fransisco, we now have many inroads into the coast, effectively pacifing it with no effort unto ourselves."
srr.10.a:0 "One more step to victory"
srr.11.t:0 "Rossi Declines"
srr.11.d:0 "Being the man that he is Rossi could never be content to just take what he has and just be happy. He and his kleptocratic lakeys are the exact kind of rot which has plauge our great nation, and we will not stand for it."
srr.11.a:0 "They will be destroyed as the traitors they are..."

It is our fighters who keep the skies above us clear, our bombers which sabotage the industries and armies of our would be destroyers, and most importantly of all, the precious fleet of DC-3's which continuously bring in fresh supplies, reinforcements, and food. We now face a dilemma however, our army is woefully underpowered compared our enemies; any attacks against them in our state would be suicidal. But we cannot simultaneously fund a massive expansion of the Army without sacrificing a decent portion of our air production; whatever our choice maybe, we must make it soon. "
