txl.1.t:0 "Seeing Glory"
txl.1.d:0 "After the Democratic Party announced a coalition ticket with the CMP, many old Dixiecrats were turned off by the new revolutionary rhetoric in the party. They saw the success of the fascist regimes in France and Italy, and many became radicalized in the face of the revolutionaries. One man to capitalize on this was William Dudley Pelley. His Silver Legion grew in popularity as hatred towards the government grew upon the announcement of the CMP-Democrat victory in the 1932 elections. With Thomas’ ascension to power upon Roosevelt’s death, the Silver Legion began to plan a coup against the government, with their Legions growing in the south. Soon, the Silver Shirts became a deadly paramilitary force, conducting raids on socialists, jews, blacks, and immigrants. Thomas ordered a crackdown on the Silver Shirts, but soon their hands were preoccupied with the Federalist Revolt. With the government distracted, Pelley rallied in Oklahoma to plan the “March on Oklahoma City”, a coup similar to Mussolini’s in Rome. The Silver Shirts were met with almost no resistance, and Pelley was named the Chief of Oklahoma. Immediately, Pelley planned to expand his ideology outwards on his quest to “save America”. He formed a pact with the KKK to unite against so called “undesirables”, and prepared a Silver Legion backed KKK invasion of Vicksburg. The invasion was initially successful, with the two factions turning the city into a vanguard of reaction. Suddenly, the League of Nations invaded the East Coast. The Klan was forced to retreat to protect their Alabama holdings, but this allowed a black uprising to overthrow the weakened Klan garrison. Pelley ordered the Silver Shirts to help his allies, but a native coalition ambushed them before they could reach the city. The Silver Legion was crushed by the Mississippi settlers and natives, forcing them to retreat back to Oklahoma, losing some land in the process. However, Pelley is determined to end the “Jewish-Catholic Plot” and bringing about the “salvation” of America."
txl.1.a:0 "Hail Pelley!"
txl.2.t:0 "The Jews"
txl.2.d:0 "The jews have been a thorn on the side of every true american. They are the reason why the stock market crashed in 1927. They are the reason the soil turned to dust here. They are the reason our great nation fell into anarchy. It is our holy duty to remove these despicable vermin from this great land, starting now."
txl.2.a:0 "Flush out these rats"
txl.3.t:0 "The Blacks"
txl.3.d:0 "Those that are worse than the jews are the blacks. The southern way of life was destroyed during the reconstruction period. The black people dared to even suggest integrating into society after they received their freedom. They have done nothing but ruin our lives and it is time we right their wrongs. We will be generous and once we have a a real foothold, we will ship to Liberia."
txl.3.a:0 "We are so generous; aren't we?"
txl.4.t:0 "The "Natives""
txl.4.d:0 "The people who claimed to have America be called their home first have been a problem for real Americans since the arrival of the Mayflower. They are uncivilized and uncultured. They do nothing but impede our progress to rebuild this great nation. William Pelley vows to cleanse Oklahoma and the surrounding lands of them."
txl.4.a:0 "First stop, Sequoyah"
