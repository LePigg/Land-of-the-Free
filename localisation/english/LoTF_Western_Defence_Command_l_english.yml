   wdc.1.t:0 "Holding the West"
   wdc.1.d:0 "With the election of the CMP-Democrat ticket, a plot within the army began to manifest. Fearing a socialist revolution, the military secretly began to draw up plans to oust the CMP from power and restore the two party system. Upon the ascension of Norman Thomas to presidency due to the assassination of FDR and frequent declaration of War Plan White to deal with the anti socialist riots, the military seized the chance. Instead of following the president’s orders, the military declared a rival government, overthrowing CMP governors from states and installing military cabinets. The Second Civil War had begun, with the battle between the Federalist Movement and CMP entering full swing. General John DeWitt convened with Federalist leader Douglas MacArthur to devise a plan to establish a Federalist base in the Rockies to secure an east base of operations against the Socialists. Thus, the Western Defence Command was established, and was able to successfully sway the anti socialist government of the rocky states to the federal cause. Immediately, the WDC began supporting MacArthur’s Mid Atlantic forces in battling the main heart of the Reds, the steel belt and Midwest. They also began to advance west, capturing eastern Idaho, before discovering an unlikely ally in the form of the Cascadian State. Led by Pat McCarran, the WDC cooperated with Cascadia to help fight the Socialist West Coast Revolutionary Army, consisting of Sinclair’s California and Seattle, which had revolted against Cascadia. Fighting in the West went smoothly at first, with the WDC pushing through the Mojave desert and Cascadia overrunning Northern California, but soon after the Socialists began Guerilla attacks across the west coast. The mass death and suppression of civil rights under DeWitt’s Junta began to upset the civilian population, which took to the streets protesting the war and DeWitt’s regime. Believing this was a work of the socialist insurgents, DeWitt began a brutal military crackdown on the civilian population, which only further hurt the legitimacy of his regime. Disgusted by the horrific acts that DeWitt had ordered the Federal Army to do, General Orlando Ward defected from the WDC and established a new regime in the Great Plains, to which DeWitt could do almost nothing about. With the Insurgents slowing the war in California and the news of the League of Nations attacking the East Coast, DeWitt was forced to move out many units that were suppressing the civil unrest to aid the fronts. Seizing their chance, the states of Colorado and Arizona broke away, and the WDC promptly began an invasion into the traitorous states. Soon after Utah defected as well, and this caused a lack of supplies to the West coast expedition and to Cascadia, destabilizing both of them. The WDC was extremely overstretched, and soon more rebellions began to prop up. The surrender of the East Coast army showed that the Federal cause was doomed, and DeWiit ordered a retreat into the central Rockies. After much fighting, the WDC was able to secure the cities of Salt Lake City from Utah and Denver from Colorado, but the rebels were still able to succeed, with the northern states defecting as well. Civil unrest still plagues the WDC, with the wounds of the Second Civil War still fresh as well defeatism from the failure of the Federalist Movement. But DeWitt has encouraged his fellow Americans to press on, and they will survive all the tasks to come."
    wdc.1.a:0 "Glory, glory hallelujah!"
    wdc.2.t:0 "Question of the Mormons"
    wdc.2.d:0 "The Mormons living along the Wasatch Front have not taken our order kindly. They have openly rebelled and sabotaged some military affairs. The question that has arised is whether we should nationalize some of their businesses to produce more guns or not."
    wdc.2.a:0 "We could really use some guns"
    wdc.2.b:0 "We shouldn't meddle in civilian affairs"
    wdc.3.t:0 "Question of Martial Law"
    wdc.3.d:0 "Many in the military junta are suggesting that martial law should be lifted since borders have finally solidified. Although, many generals argue against it as it would make traitors have an easier time to sabotage our plans. In the end, DeWitt decides.."
    wdc.3.a:0 "Martial law will stay"
    wdc.3.b:0 "Martial law will be lifted"
    wdc.4.t:0 "Question of the Natives"
    wdc.4.d:0 "The Natives of the Great Plains and Rockies have not been treated the nicest out of all the people under our watch. The question is whether we should enforce conscription on the local tribes or to leave them alone."
    wdc.4.a:0 "We need any available men at this point"
    wdc.4.b:0 "Leave them be"
    wdc.5.t:0 "Question of the Civilians"
    wdc.5.d:0 "Not all civilians are necessarily evil. Although, some are more suspectable to be traitors than others; like the mormons. DeWitt proposes that certain mormons should be placed in "internment camps" until further notice. Some generals do object to this as it is illegal, according to the constitution, to detain someone without placing them under arrest."
    wdc.5.a:0 "Issue out Executive Order 9066"
    wdc.5.b:0 "We don't have to take distrastic measures"
    wdc.6.t:0 "Question of the Companies"
    wdc.6.d:0 "As the most legitimate warlord in the United States, many companies are offering their services in exchange for loans later down the road and protection now. The issue is whether their services should be to help the military or help the people"
    wdc.6.a:0 "The military deserve more"
    wdc.6.b:0 "The people could use some relief"
    wdc.8.t:0 "End of the Line"
     wdc.8.d:0 "Edwin Johnson sat in a dark room somewhere in Denver in a basement awaiting execution. Everyone knows the drill; treason's punishment is the death penalty. He was put on trial, but it was only just a show. The people must understand what happens when you betray the federal government. Of course, the jury found him guilty on all accounts with the punishment of the highest: death. Now he was in a dark and damp room with a blindfold on in front of a firing squad. There is nothing more for him to say. What is the use of arguing with damned fools?"
     wdc.8.a:0 "Only God forgives traitors"
     wdc.10.t:0 "A Permanent Lesson"
     wdc.10.d:0 "The American Indians never learn. Will they ever realize that rebelling against our great nation is futile? In this case, they must pay the ultimate price for declaring their own nation and waging war against us. We will show no mercy as they have shown to the loyal americans living in their clique territory. This tolerance of their wrongdoings ends now."
     wdc.10.a:0 "Gone for good"
     wdc.7.t:0 "A Distant Memory"
     wdc.7.d:0 "Absaroka was never really part of the Union. It was made up by petty disgruntled farmers who wanted nothing to do with the local tri-state area. The radical wicked movement named "The Free Absarokan Party" has ambitions alarmingly similar to the fascist countries of France and Italy across the Atlantic Ocean. Fortunately, our brave men squashed this feeble state and secured the Northern Border. This disgusting movement must be hidden from the public and the history books for America has no empathy for psychopaths."
     wdc.7.a:0 "Like it never happened"
     wdc.9.t:0 "The Misguided"
     wdc.9.d:0 "The Mormons never knew better. Why can't they understand that internment camps were for their own good? We cannot have let them stay as civilians without the risk of a security leak. With the radical threat from St. George vanquished, it is only fair we release them back to civilian life. Those who collaborated with the mormons in St. George will be investigated and all mormons will be subject to searches and interrogations to ensure another rebellion never happens again."
     wdc.9.a:0 "The things we do for the Union..."
     wdc.11.t:0 "Knife to the Back"
     wdc.11.d:0 "Giving Senator Ashurst governorship of Arizona was a complete mistake. How could we have known that he would raise his own milita to stab us in the back? Nevertheless, his fate was sealed along with all the belligerents that tried toppling our government. They were simply no match for our powerful well-trained army. Ashurst was caught along with his cabinet memebers crossing the Colorado River into California and were shot on the spot."
     wdc.11.a:0 "Can we really trust anybody?"
     wdc.12.t:0 "Warring States"
     wdc.12.d:0 "Our military advisors and leader have unanimously agreed that now is the best time to expand into our neighbors' lands in order to secure our position much better. The war machine has been turned on once again for the better of our country."
     wdc.12.a:0 "One step closer to unification"
