abs.1.t:0 "A Fragile Republic"
abs.1.d:0 "Before the Great Collapse, the region now called Absaroka was very prosperous. Every ten miles would there be a mining town filled with people searching for tungsten. As the country began to fall apart, many people became worried whether the federal government could continue to support them. After the WDC began to crack down on dissidents after the west coast seceded, fellow absarokans began to rise up. A. R. Swickward promised the people one thing: freedom. Now that the WDC has given up retaking North Wyoming (for now), the state constitution can finally be created and the people can be helped. This recent rebellion aginst the tyranny of the Lakotah government is only the start of our new revolution. If only the rest of America could be considered Absarokans could they be as prosperous as we are today. We must win this fight today to keep fighting tomorrow."
abs.1.a:0 "Freedom for all"
abs.2.t:0 "Question of Currency"
abs.2.d:0 "Many people in Absaroka believe that we plan to set up a provisional state government until a more legitamite democratic government reaches our borders. Swickward isn't really sure of the future of Absaroka, but he plans on expanding the borders in the name of security. The question today is whether absarokans should continue using USD or create their own."
abs.2.a:0 "Let's stick with the USD"
abs.2.b:0 "Let's create our own"
abs.3.t:0 "Sheridan Agreement"
abs.3.d:0 "The evil WDC must be taken down at all costs. This means allying with the enemies of the WDC. Two candidates are up for consideration; the mormons of Deseret and the confederationists of Pueblo. The agreement is very simple. We will all attack the WDC together at the same time and form a defensive pact. Let us send our proposals to them."
abs.3.a:0 "There's no way they will refuse"
abs.4.t:0 "An Invitation from Absaroka"
abs.4.d:0 "A group of diplomats from Absaroka have suggested that we form an coalition to destroy the Western Defence Commmand once and for all. The absarokans promised us that in return for helping them, we shall gain control of the Wasatch Front. This is an offer we cannot refuse as this is our only chance of reuniting all mormons under one banner."
abs.4.a:0 "Count us in"
abs.5.t:0 "An Invitation from Absaroka"
abs.5.d:0 "A group of diplomats from Absaroka have suggested that we form an coalition to destroy the Western Defence Commmand once and for all. The absarokans promised us that in return for helping them, we shall gain control of all of Colorado. This is an offer we cannot refuse as this is our only chance of reuniting the United States under a great confederation."
abs.5.a:0 "Count us in"
abs.6.t:0 "Deseret's Reply"
abs.6.d:0 "Heber Grant has accepted our offer for an alliance!"
abs.6.a:0 "Great!"
abs.7.t:0 "Pueblo's Reply"
abs.7.d:0 "Edwin Johnson has accepted our offer for an alliance!"
abs.7.a:0 "Good!"
abs.8.t:0 "Operation: Judgement Day"
abs.8.d:0 "Absaroka has called upon us to carry out the purpose of the Sheridan Pact. It is in our best interests to join this war and secure as much land as possible."
abs.8.a:0 "To arms!"
abs.9.t:0 "The Fate of the Loyalists"
abs.9.d:0 "Now that the whole WDC is gone, it is time to decide what will happen to the citizens living in our occupied lands. We have provided many ways of defecting from the WDC over and over. We can either make an example of them or we can show them mercy."
abs.9.a:0 "Bystanders are worse than the perpetrators"
abs.9.b:0 "Malice for none"
abs.10.t:0 "A Deal's a Deal"
abs.10.d:0 "Now that the Western Defence Command is gone, its time we rightfully divide up the land. Though the lands of Nebraska and southern Wyoming were never sepcified to who will be the controller, Salt Lake City, Badlands, and Colorado will be given to their respective owners."
abs.10.a:0 "Whatever"
 abs.13.t:0 "The Fallacy of Democracy"
 abs.13.d:0 "Pueblo has served as a great ally and possibly our countries could have united. Their beliefs of a flawed democracy weaker than what the Western Defence Command claimed to be defending ultimately makes their government too weak to compare to ours. They simply do not understand the need for a united race and strong government during turbulent times. Their idea of a loose confederacy is not compatible at all with our values. Sadly, our former allies must meet their fate so we can secure our position."
 abs.13.a:0 "Another lifetime perhaps"
 abs.12.t:0 "Crossing Nevada"
 abs.12.d:0 "The mormons that helped us defeat the Western Defence Command served rather well as useful idiots. Now that we have taken over the land surrounding Utah, we must give the mormons two choices: assimilate or face deportation. Seeing that these people are highly resilient from their oppression by the WDC, most chose to fight back. Thankfully, our military and police have relocated all resistance and moved the mormons west into the barren state of Nevada for some other government to deal with them. "
 abs.12.a:0 "They will find a way to live"
 abs.11.t:0 "Loyalty to None"
 abs.11.d:0 "No more does Phoenix stay as a beacon of liberal democracy, but instead a part of our great nation, Absaroka. The state of Arizona was highly developed for its small population. When we asked if they would like to join our cause, they rudely rejected our extended olive branch and called us "traitors" and "fascists" despite us being neither one. Nevertheless, reducation has begun and conversion of able troops has started."
 abs.11.a:0 "Barbaric? Of course not"
