com.1.t:0 "The Common Man Marches On" 
com.1.d:0 "As the center of the American socialist movement, the CMP largely held power among the millions of factory workers within the Great Lakes who were subject to the wage slavery of their bosses. Although the CMP had many ideas for a nominee for president, Norman Thomas was chosen via an agreement within the factions. Although a moderate, Norman still was an avid supporter of solidarity and worker’s rights, and many hoped his stance would prevent the onset of a violent Revolution like in Russia years ago. But the moment he assumed power from the fallen president Franklin D. Roosevelt, the nation collapsed into anarchy as the Federalist’s challenged Thomas’ legitimacy. Returning to Chicago, a provisional capital was created for the American Socialist Republic welcoming Thomas as the true president of America and directing the rest of the socialist factions throughout the nation in their war against MacArthur’s regime. Thomas wished for peace and reconciliation, hoping that a reformed form of capitalism could be implemented to prevent radicalization, but as the civil war dragged on Thomas was repeatedly forced to enact harsh measures by radicals within the CMP, calling for total government control of the economy and harsh crackdowns on “reactionaries”. Norman soon became a doomed puppet president to his own party, powerless to prevent the increasingly radical revolution within the nation. However, it all came crashing down when Soviet intervention was requested: the party shattered, with many of Norman’s most loyal forces and voters defecting to various warlord fiefdoms. The League intervention finally toppled the socialist state, and along with the Federalists the United States ceased to exist. Thomas now sits in the oval office of the metropolis, hoping that one day the nation would be united once more and at peace with solidarity for all, but this remains to be seen as Thomas regresses into nothing more than a figurehead. Although he controls his most firm voter base and won a few early battles against Federal forces from Iowa and Ohio, the state of the socialist central government is dire: the party fights amongst itself as riots and insurgencies threaten everyday life. Whether the Second American Revolution will truly succeed remains to be seen."

com.3.t:0 "Dealing with the Corporate Stranglehold"
com.3.d:0 "Although our base of operations is secure, as the Great Lakes has always been a bastion of the worker’s plight, the class struggle continues within our borders. During the Civil War many of the bourgeoisie factory and business owners outright refused to provide materiel to our war effort, preventing us from fully utilizing the industrial power of the region. Due to the Federalist threat, only a few factories were successfully taken over by the Red Guards to utilize for the war, but the crooked kleptocrats that control the industries still have a chokehold on our workforce. If we are to not only rebuild our damaged nation but also fulfill our campaign promises, we have much work to do. Norman Thomas plans to pass a bill that will formally nationalize the big businesses and dismantle their corporate empires so that they may rob the working class no more. However, the influence of the corporatists might get in the way of the bill successfully being implemented. To counteract this, the Vanguard wing has planned to violently seize any factories refusing to comply using military force, and then conscripting the businessmen into work camps where they will toil for their crimes. However, the more liberal factions think these approaches are quite simply too radical and detrimental to the American Dream, and have suggested we simply buy the factories out. "

com.5.d:0 "Thomas had been sitting in his office all week. He had been too nervous to go outside ever since the results of the recent election had been tallied. He had promised Americans a new age of freedom, prosperity, and solidarity, but under his presidency America had shattered into warring fiefdoms, and the nation may never truly recover. All he could feel was a stunning sense of guilt. How could he, a man which had brought misery to millions, be worthy of leading the Land of the Free? After hours of pacing and pondering, he finally mustered up the might to leave the Chicago capitol. He had already accepted that his run was over. Perhaps a better man, one who could fulfill the promises he failed to bring himself, could repair this shattered nation. But as he went outside, he saw a cheering crowd, waving the flag of the socialist republic, cheering his name. Over the radio, he heard words he never expected…"

com.7.t:0 "The Trial of Mark Clark"
com.7.d:0 "With the fall of the final defenses of the Monarchist forces, a team of marines successfully apprehended Mark Clark, and after subduing him with batons, he was dragged off to a court in Michigan. The so-called Mad Regent was to be tried under the accounts of treason and war crimes, but the trial became a source of great controversy. Clark affirmed Thomas at first as the legitimate president of the United States and led multiple campaigns against Federalist partisans in the Midwest. As the war dragged on, the repression against civilians ordered upon him by the Vanguard wing whittled his sanity, and the humiliating defeat in the East Coast intervention perhaps drove him mad. The more liberal wings of the CMP have requested a plea for insanity, and for Clark to be moved instead to a mental asylum due to his status of a hero during the civil war. However, the very same Vanguardists and even some moderates consider him to be just as much of a traitor as Lindbergh or MacArthur, and he must be executed for betraying us. They note how the Tsar of Russia met his end in order to fulfill the Russian Revolution, and Mark must meet the same fate. Ultimately, the court rules decides to…"

com.8.t:0 "The End of the Caesar"
com.8.d:0 "As the Federalist scum were pushed back into the Mississippi river line, general MacArthur was still unable to accept the inevitability of the revolution. He once again assured to his men that “He would return” to “liberate” America from our rule. But as the river tugboats attempted to cross, a motorized detachment quickly broke through his escorts, and soon, the boat was surrounded. The guards put up no fight, but MacArthur refused to concede. He attempted suicide with his handgun, but after being tackled by one of the Red Guards, he misfired, only scraping his forehead but knocking himself out. MacArthur was dragged to a court case in Chicago for his numerous crimes against the American people. He attempted to defend his honor, but the senate was unsympathetic to his cause, met with stern silence. Ultimately, he was found guilty of conspiring against the democratically elected government, abuse of power, corruption, and many war crimes for the atrocities of the Federalists during the civil war. He was promptly sentenced to death. As the firing squad prepared his execution, he gave one last parting word. “I am a soldier. A man who sacrifices his life for his own nation. I saw a future, full of misery, death, and an end to our democratic traditions. I did what many did before us, and stood up to tyranny as I saw fit. But it appears history may be the judge. I may never fully be forgiven, but neither will you commie scum. But one thing is for certain, that my role as a loyal soldier to the stars and stripes has reached it’s end, and now, I may fade away.” The guns echoed through the room, and MacArthur collapsed to the ground."

COM.9.t:0 "Unexpected Arrival"
COM.9.d:0 "Despite our support and hard effort, our expedition to Iowa has been unable to secure the Midwest. However, things are not all bleak, as general Devers was able to successfully escape to the border with a few battalions accompanying him. The mission was not a total failure: we have learned valuable lessons, and hopefully we’ll be back soon to continue the revolution."
COM.9.a:0 "You'll be remembered, heroes of the revolution!"
COM.10.t:0 "And the Boots Stopped"
COM.10.d:0 "Father Joseph had been locked up in the Michigan state prison ever since the damned reds took over the northern states. He had protested the CMP’s departure from Christian ideals that the United States had been built on. He pushed for civil disobedience, but communist and anarchist militias within their ranks usually would violently break up the protests he held. The actual CMP’s government policy on the Church was secularism, but radicals within their armies had been caught burning religious symbols and demolishing Churches, and Joseph would take no chances. When the Federalists arrived in Detroit, Joseph was interned in the Detroit Prison under fears he would instill rebellion among Michigan’s population. Martial Law went into effect soon after, and frequently communist militias nicknamed “Browderites” were given free reign over lower Michigan, never relenting in their assaults upon dissidents. One day, a Browderite, in their staple brown and red uniform approached his cell. Joseph had not seen one in a while, but he knew that when they arrived in the cell rooms, they dragged someone off, never to be seen again. The man approached his cell, and Joseph did one last prayer before he would meet judgment. The man took a key out and opened the cell, stepping aside. He held his arm out, signaling “step out.” Joseph complied, replying “so where will you drag me off to now…”. “Hmm? Oh, you get to leave.” replied the guard. Joseph was shocked. “Martial law is over, and you have been pardoned for your crimes. Now get out of here before I tell the judge to change his mind.”"
COM.10.a:0 "A return to normalcy."
COM.11.t:0 "Emancipation"
COM.11.d:0 "As the Red Guards pushed closer into the heart of the Legionary state, the sheer resistance of their forces only grew in intensity. Mass infantry attacks no better then suicide chargers continuously attempted to break through any opening found in our lines, and although they suffered massive casualties, the fanatical nature of their armies proved that even when faced with defeat this struggling animal of a nation would not stop fighting back. As our forces entered Indianapolis, buildings were leveled to the ground to prevent us from gaining control over them, and partisan attacks from the populace only intensified as we pushed further towards the capital. However, the Legion’s horrific policies made them many internal enemies as well, as slave labor camps and thousands of jailed dissidents were freed as we advanced. Just like the civil war a century ago, the freed joined our forces as we advanced to subdue the fascist’s armies. In a final assault on the capitol, Klan militias and child soldiers attempted to slow our advance, but were unable to prevent our liberation of the capitol. An elite brigade of Red Guards stormed the capitol building, opening fire at the paramilitary forces tasked with protecting the Legion’s high command. Although victory was imminent, they refused to surrender, as sporadic resistance continued throughout Indiana, but as their prisoners were freed, the amount of those resisting began to dwindle compared to those taking up arms against their oppressors. Charles Lindbergh had never left the capitol building, and refused to accept defeat at the hands of our revolutionary forces. As the last of his bodyguards were cleared up or surrendered, a brigade entered the room he was residing in at the top floor of the building. Immediately, Lindbergh took up arms, firing multiple shots at them with a snub nose. Although he managed to graze two of the Red Guards, the rest opened fire at him. The strike of the bullets against him knocked him backwards toward the window, shattering it. Lindbergh grunted before plummeting to the ground 50 feet below. A search to find Gerald Smith was inconclusive, with rumors that a klan militia from Kentucky had snuck him out of Indiana once it was clear the war was lost, but with the death of Charles Lindbergh, the legion’s central leadership collapsed. Soon, the fighting stopped, and in a massive parade held by our forces, thousands cheered for the liberation of the state from the fascist menace. [Root.GetLeader] announced a speech to remember those that had lost their lives in the assault on the legionary capital and the legion’s horrific oppression, and assured that with the fall of Charles Lindbergh, the workers of America were one step closer to liberation."
COM.11.a:0 "A fitting end."
COM.12.t:0 "The Death of Butler"
COM.12.d:0 "After a battle with an illness in his colon, Marine Corps general Smedley Butler has passed away. He served a long career in the armed forces of America, serving from the Spanish American War to the Second Civil War. One of the few men in the army to recognize the failures of capitalism, Butler felt as if he had betrayed himself and everyone around him by serving the interests of the greedy businessmen that brought America to her knees, and was determined to redeem himself. Affirming Thomas as the legitimate president of America, he led the Red Guards against the reactionary forces of the Federalists and League of Nations, proving himself to be once more a formidable fighter. With his death, we mourn the loss of a true American hero who truly understood the plight of the workers across the world, and made bold sacrifices to bring about the revolution. Norman Thomas has arranged a state funeral for Butler, and he will be laid to rest within the month."
COM.12.a:0 "A hero to us all."
COM.13.t:0 "The Fate of the Mutineers"
COM.13.d:0 "With the capture of Columbus, the men of the Ohioan Expedition could resist our forces no longer and pressed for peace. Robert Beightler had been captured in the siege of the capital, and had been relocated to a state prison in Michigan. Meanwhile, the rest of the Ohioan military have been taken to a military tribunal in Gary. Although they were formerly Federalists, they had defected from MacArthur’s command to pursue peace with us to end the war in exchange for neutrality, but this promise went unfulfilled. But due to their willingness to compromise, we may be able to recruit these former Federals into our ranks."
COM.13.a:0 "Traitors don't deserve mercy."
COM.13.b:0 "Together against Tyranny!"
COM.14.t:0 "Paranoia"
COM.14.d:0 "Although the insurgency threat is mainly posed by reactionaries and various criminal groups, there has been concern of potential dissent within our own ranks. We have seen our Soviet comrades deal with the aftermath of the Stalinist Plot, and in return our own CMP party members have become increasingly paranoid. Norman Thomas has tried to reassure them, but the continued threat of inter factional infighting cannot be denied.  So far, we have created plans for an investigation led by one of 3 agencies to investigate this dissent. The first option is to hand the plans over to the so-called Browderites, who while feared for their ruthlessness, are known for their efficiency. However, to avoid accusations of secret police terror, some have decided to just let local police and militia units search for themselves, potentially avoiding a Great Purge led by the radicals. The last option is to hand the investigation to the army, that while certain in their loyalty to the socialist republic, they hold potentially the most reactionary sympathies out of anyone in the bureaucracy."
COM.14.a:0 "Let the Browderites do it."
COM.14.b:0 "The people are trustworthy."
COM.14.c:0 "The army will prove themselves oncemore."
COM.15.t:0 "Politicians Arrested"
COM.15.d:0 "Although the capitalist parties were unbanned, the Vanguardists were angered severely by the prospect. Now that the Browderites were placed into the ultimate security authority, they swiftly moved into strongholds for the old order. Hundreds of politicians and conservatives were found guilty of plotting against the state and subsequently arrested. Many were beaten and tortured to confess their guilt, with one such incident of the mayor of Gary’s confession note being stained with blood when turned in. The investigation has not finished, and many more are being found guilty by the day."
COM.15.a:0 "Wait, what?"
COM.16.t:0 "Traitors in the Party"
COM.16.d:0 "In the middle of a speech to Congress given by President Thomas, multiple guards charged into the room. They proceeded to list the names of several CMP officials who had been conspiring against the stability of the state and actively bolstering resistance activity. Thomas tried to interject that there was no real evidence, but several men in the room were rounded up and dragged out of the room. Reports have come in that James Renshaw Cox is currently under house arrest, and as Browder’s influence grows, he has requested the banning of the Reformist wing of the party to ensure the Revolution may be carried out. With the high power the Browderites hold, we may be powerless to stop this."
COM.16.a:0 "Are we going too far?"
COM.17.t:0 "Military Inspections"
COM.17.d:0 "As the investigation continues, the supposedly conservative rooted military has become the subject of a massive investigation. Minor leaders among the officer corps and certain divisions have been accused of holding pro-Federalist sympathies and arrested. Entire divisions and boot camps have been rounded up under suspicion of treason. Smedley Butler has denounced this act, claiming that “these good men deserve better than this”, but due to the ongoing threat of potential treason the inspections continue."
COM.17.a:0 "Can we even trust our own?"
COM.18.t:0 "Mission Complete"
COM.18.d:0 "It had been the third day since the strike. The craftsman union had protested the national government’s violent expulsion of union members of Congress in order to enforce the new “National Quota” system. Knox, a man who had been with the union for years, arrived on the scene to give a speech to the crowd. “Dey promised us folks dey would respect the rights ov all the workers, but deys have lied! Thomas n his goons are a buncha good for nothin’ tyrants!”. However, as the strike grew, the people noticed a convoy of trucks moving towards the strikers. The trucks unloaded columns of officers, with a massive megaphone. “Halt. The loyal government to the revolution demands the strike cease immediately.”. The strikers continued to demand an end to the National Quota system, with police units coming out to beat any that got too close to the trucks. However, within the chaos, a rogue gunshot rang. The scene descended into chaos, as the officers ordered their men to draw their weapons and fire into the crowd. Knox immediately attempted to flee, but the stampede of workers kept blocking him as the rifles cracked into the air. At the very end, 11 lay dead, and several more wounded. The incident was quickly covered up, and any questions of dissenting views were swiftly repressed by the CIA. Knox had managed to escape with a few bruises, but his name was now on the watchlist, and shortly before returning home, he was ambushed by several officers and arrested. The red sky emanated in the distance, and soon, the remaining reactionary counter-revolutionaries were soon to be captured to secure our revolution."
COM.18.a:0 "At least we are safe now..."
COM.19.t:0 "Inspections Slowing Down"
COM.19.d:0 "A rather embarrassing event occurred today. The police arrived in Detroit to try and investigate a lead on a potentially group of dissenting rebels operating within the city. A teen was seen walking about in a warehouse, alone. The police, alongside a few independent militias, approached him for questioning as to what he was doing, but he took off. A chase unfurled, but he was able to escape into a munitions facility. The police proceeded to attempt a storming of the building, but the militia units immediately began shooting the building with their revolvers. A confrontation between the two groups broke out, with one of the officers knocking one of the militiamen with the heel of his gun. After the debacle was over, they finally decided to enter the building, but the boy had vanished. After this humiliating event, the militias assigned to work on the investigation refused to work with the police."
COM.19.a:0 "..."
COM.20.t:0 "Communists Blamed"
COM.20.d:0 "With no real lead located, the police have resorted to scapegoating. The red militia were blamed for getting in the way of the investigations, and have entered open conflict with the police. Due to the militia's radical sympathies, members of the Vanguard wing have begun to openly criticize the police’s actions, with their leader Earl Browder even calling the police “bumbling reactionaries getting in the way of things.” In response, there have been multiple arrests of communist party officials. The Browderites were expelled from the police force, and most of the civilian law enforcement has initiated a heavy crackdown on the communist secret police. Although the communists are gaining an increasingly threatening grip of power on our nation, the incidents have only allowed more of the actual culprits to get away."
COM.20.a:0 "This is not the solidarity I want!"
COM.21.t:0 "Gang Violence Stopped in Chicago"
COM.21.d:0 "While the former secret police were once the ones responsible for overseeing the law enforcement in the capital, their fall has had them replaced with the civilian police forces. A detachment sent in to investigate increased murder rates within the capital found local gangs to be the culprit. Although they are by no means the main perpetrators of our internal strife, the police managed to stop multiple gangs from terrorizing the local population, ensuring stability in our capital."
COM.21.a:0 "Good news, at least."
COM.22.t:0 "Ringleaders Stopped"
COM.22.d:0 "A local detachment of the police operating in Detroit noticed strange movements of vehicles within the outskirts of the city. Upon entering, a group of what at first seemed to be bandits looting a truck were seen driving around with military grade weapons. They were later revealed to be wearing Federalist militia uniforms, and had been smuggling in weapons to reactionary forces operating within the country. The military police were called in to raid a facility, near the one in the first investigation, where their leadership was located. A brief firefight broke out, but after the building was surrounded, their resistance gave in. Their leaders were arrested, and although the threat from reactionaries continues, we have made great progress in stopping the lingering insurgency."
COM.22.a:0 "That paid off."
COM.23.t:0 "Military Budget Increased"
COM.23.d:0 "In preparation for Operation SIGNAL, the military has requested additional funds be siphoned towards them. Special operation and infiltration squads will be funded, and now that the military is prepared to open up a new front at home, we must begin to increase their budget."
COM.23.a:0 "Hopefully this is worth it."
COM.24.t:0 "Crackdowns in Michigan"
COM.24.d:0 "Although martial law is officially over in Michigan, a regiment from northern Indiana has once again marched into southern Michigan. The provisional governor has been removed, and Heitke has been named military governor of the region. Many still suspect the state of harboring Federalist sympathies, and is a top priority for counter-insurgency operations. However, the local populace displaced anger at the return of military rule, and have taken to the streets in demonstration. The reaction was swift, however, and soon a local protest was framed as being infiltrated by the Federalists. Spec Ops forces have raided multiple buildings and protest hotspots, and the sound of bullets has once again entered the city. While martial law escalates, the violence will appear to as well."
COM.24.a:0 "Tone it down, will ya?"
COM.25.t:0 "No Better than the Feds!"
COM.25.d:0 "Martial law has begun to encompass northern Indiana and Toledo, and now that the military is operating out of the former insurgent areas, unrest has increased. A local politician of the liberal wing has begun to accuse the army of Bonpartism and has pressed the government to stop the military escalation. However, the next day, he was swiftly detained by the army, and has been dragged out for interrogation of potential collaboration with the insurgents, but this has only strengthened his position. People have begun to make comparisons to this new state of affairs to the tyranny of MacArthur. Our legitimacy has paid a grave price."
COM.25.a:0 "All we need is order!"
COM.26.t:0 "The Violence Fades"
COM.26.d:0 "But as escalations continue, the insurgency seems to be weakening as the days go by. The army has successfully assaulted and destroyed multiple terrorist groups run by counterrevolutionaries in the past few days. Factory bombings decrease by the day, and despite the constant presence of the Red Guards, the sounds of gunfire have begun to fade. It seems peace and stability may soon return."
COM.26.a:0 "Victory at last."
COM.27.t:0 "All the King's Men"
COM.27.d:0 "With Mark’s trial out of the way, we now turn our attention to the remaining generals and soldiers in Mark’s “Royal Army.“ It is unknown whether they truly believed in monarchism or were driven by blind loyalty to their forces, but now before a secret meeting with top officials within our military we shall discover their intentions. General Oscar Koch, Merrit Edson, and George Shaw have testified before the military command council. Merrit Edson has affirmed that his respect for Clark and time under his command motivated him to follow through with Clark’s orders although he did not not believe in monarchism himself. On the other hand, George Shaw and Oscar Koch said they felt loyalty to the state of Wisconsin and would rather betray America’s Republican roots than take up arms against their own. Shaw himself is a hero of the Philippines Insurgency, so keeping him alive might be in our best interests, and as for the others, although it might cost us public face, our military is in great need of more great minds to reform it into a force that can save America."
COM.27.a:0 "Welcome back into the fray."
COM.27.b:0 "Shaw is good propaganda material, the rest are untrustworthy."
COM.27.c:0 "They made their choice, pay them in kind!"
COM.28.t:0 "No Where to Run"
COM.28.d:0 "Walter B. Smith frantically ran throughout the Springfield bunker systems. The socialists had successfully broken into the capital. The League had ignored his pleas for help, and without the help of his benefactors, the Expeditionary force began to crumble under the invading force of the new Red Army. He had tried to flee over the border to Kentucky, but he was repeatedly turned back by lingering Legionary sympathizers in the state. With no where to go, he could only hope for the best. “I can’t die now”, he thought to himself. “I beat those fascist scum, and now, the fucking reds are gonna kill me!”. He was filled with deep sorrow. He knew that he would not be remembered as the vanquisher of fascism, but as the British lapdog. He hunched up in the corner, ready to accept his fate. A detachment of a commissar and two infantrymen broke into the room, seeing Walter on the floor. As he noticed them, he realized that he was not ready for death. “No, wai-” he cried, but the commissar shot him with his revolver, and Walter crumpled to the floor."
COM.28.a:0 "We'll be back, Lady Liberty!"
COM.29.t:0 "The Chicagan Delegation"
COM.29.d:0 "With the official reestablishment of relations with the Norman government, an official embassy in Minneapolis to the Chicagan delegation has been made. Slowly, people within our state have begun to sympathize with Norman’s cause, due to his status as the legitimately elected president of the United States, and some have even supported causes to return the true president to office. However, we have noticed that the Chicagan military has begun to build up on our border. Their demands are simple, that our state be reincorporated into the American Socialist Republic and to affirm Norman’s legitimacy as the true president. Should we give into these demands?"
COM.29.a:0 "In the name of the Constitution, I shall comply."
COM.29.b:0 "I won't let these commies bring America to her knees again!"
COM.30.t:0 "Returning to Minnesota"
COM.30.d:0 "The border guards in Minnesota have stood down. This is a massive victory for diplomacy and the plight of the working class, and one step closer towards reuniting the nation."
COM.30.a:0 "Have these upper class collaborators redeemed themselves?"
COM.31.t:0 "The Second Betrayal"
COM.31.d:0 "We should’ve known those bastards in Minnesota were not to be trusted. They had betrayed us during the war with the Federalists, and due to the League intervention we were unable to bring justice to this capitalism with a coat of red paint."
COM.31.a:0 "This time we'll finish the job!"
COM.33.t:0 "Final Stand Under the Red Flag"
COM.33.d:0 "The enemies of the Second Revolution have us surrounded, and our forces are stretched thin. But this is not the end, the legitimacy of president Thomas and the will of the people strong in command will prevail over the reactionary hordes! They cannot extinguish the revolution!"
COM.33.a:0 "Under the flag we live and die!"
COM.32.t:0 "Duty Calls"
COM.32.d:0 "Heitke had been sitting on the border for 3 hours now. He was expecting Devers' brigade to return to Chicago, but he had his doubts. “We sent a bunch of untrained cadets to fight the damn Feds”. All he could think of was the absolute slaughter. There was no way such an unorganized force could have survived against the Federalists. He was getting ready to call back to base when he heard his radio buzz. “Hey man, it’s me.”. Heitke couldn’t believe it. “It was an easy in and out, those damn Feds didn’t stand a chance.” Devers’ voice resonated over the comms. A convoy of armored vehicles appeared over the horizon: the force was intact."
COM.32.a:0 "The revolution has been secured."
