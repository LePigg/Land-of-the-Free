skn.1.t:0 "Holding Out"
 skn.1.d:0 "While the rest of the United States burned to the ground, the state of Idaho remained relatively peaceful. When the adjacent states of Oregon, Washington, and Utah fell into utter chaos, William Borah was extremely hesitant to send his local troops to help his fellow senators. Without his help, libertarian rebels had overthrown McNary and had him executed. To make it up to the people, Borah retook Eastern Washington State from the Seattle Communists. During this offensive, a coalition of Native Americans occupied the surrounding areas of Boise, leaving Idaho isolated in the city of Spokane. The next election for the republic is around the corner. Despite all the major blunders, Borah remains the most popular republican candidate. The most notable opposition to him is Homer Bone, a uniqe senator who has notoriously switched parties multiple times and has campaigned with wild promises."
 skn.1.a:0 "Democracy Prevails"
 skn.2.t:0 "The Election of 1936"
 skn.2.d:0 "Election week has come and the people must did their civic duty by voting for one of the two main candidates. The Republican Party's candidate, William Borah, promises the return of normalcy and stability while the Democratic Party promises change and enforcing the people's will under their candidate Homer Bone. The election is too close to call."

 skn.sho.cap.t:0 "Home At Last"
 skn.sho.cap.d:0 "After months of constant war with the Shoshone people, the glorious city of Boise is back in our hands. We can safely proclaim that we have redeemed ourselves and the people of America. Democracy was left dying in the mountains surrounding Spokane, but has returned back to an authentic state capitol. Let us celebrate tonight. We have much more to do to save America."
 skn.sho.cap.a:0 "Order a victory parade on Main Street tommorrow!"
 skn.5.t:0 "Washington State"
 skn.5.d:0 "Our valiant forces has successfully destroyed the Seattle Commune's army and captured the metropolitian area. A fast process of reversing communist propaganda and freeing political prisoners has taken effect at full force. Although the communist regime has completely changed the state into a dystopia, we will try our best to deliver democracy and freedom back to the people. Many who had government positions in the Seattle Commune were able to escape to Siberia through merchant ships."
 skn.5.a:0 "Those bastards escaped justice!"
 skn.6.t:0 "The Trial of the Traitor"
 skn.6.d:0 "Mencken walked begrudgingly into the courtroom along with his jail guards. He knew that the Spokane Milita were going try their damndest to capture him alive yet he refused to take his cyanide pill. As a result of his cowardice, he stands trial in front of seven judges. The whole trial was a blur; the only two things he could remember were that he had pled not guilty and he was sentenced to death for treason. His lawyer tried his to defend Mencken but there really is no way to beat a system stacked against you."
 skn.6.a:0 "Off to the gallows"
 skn.7.t:0 "Anithero Cincinnatus"
 skn.7.d:0 "Senator McCarran used to be a moderate anti-communist and loved by Nevadans before the Collapse. Recently, he has turned into an insatiable hedonist who has turned the Great Basin into vice country. The worst red scare witch hunt has been going on for several years with no sign of stopping until we put the mad dog down. The governor of Nevada gave him executive power in hopes of keeping Nevada intact as the rest of the country fell apart. Sadly, McCarran took the situation to his advantage which has led to his own demise."
 skn.7.a:0 "The People of Nevada are finally free"
