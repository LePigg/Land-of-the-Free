 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Shattered America"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After a decade of an ineffective government that couldn't recover from the Great Depression, many states and factions broke away from the Union. Each dreaming of taking over the Continental United States with their own ideology as the head of the government. Most states still suffer from the Great Depression, but are determined to survive and thrive."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 MIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Minnesota has always been a beacon of social democracy and progressivism with Floyd Olson being the leader of the movement. When President Thomas was inaugarated, the state was ecstatic, but the feeling faded away as Thomas began working with the Soviets. The state senate was torn between supporting the Federalistss or Thomas and ultimately decided to not intervene. Left with no allies and low public morale, Minneapolis stands as the only beacon of democracy and the last remnant of the true United States of America."
 IWA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A rump state controlled by the remnants of a Federalist army. MacNider had failed to link up with MacArthur and now deals with the heaping unrest from the local population. With nowhere to run and allies sparce, General MacNider must united Iowa and avenge his failed offensives from the past."
 BMK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Buiness Plot was a plan to coup former President Thomas and install a dictatorial president that would do big companies' biddings. When the Federalist rose up, the plan sprang into action. With the growing anarchy engulfing all of the US, the plan was executed far too late and its failure only increased the public's panic. Fearing repercussions from the socialist, federalists, and League of Nations, prominent business men under the guidance of Geral MacGuire fled out east. With nowhere in relative peace, they were exiled to the cold plains of North Dakota hoping to regain power and influence one day."
 COM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the quick collapse of the short-lived American Socialist Republic due to both Federalist and League of Nations forces, president Norman Thomas was forced to flee to one of his strongest voter bases, Chicago. Before long, they located a Federalist army trying to establish control over the Great Lakes. After fierce fighting, the Red Guards prevailed, cutting the federal forces in two, with one side taking cover in Michigan while another fled across Ohio. Now, Chicago stands surrounded by many enemies and suffers from internal instability, but Norman Thomas has promised that the Second American Revolution will not be stopped."
 MIL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Once parts of the Socialist military ranks, Mark Clark is now seen as the madman of America. After consecutive failed offensives, Mark began to wonder why the American experiment had failed. Neither faction of the war had a strong leader that the people could rally around. Clark realised that only a king could maintain national unity. The biggest problem is that the only descendant of George Washington is rumored to live in Texas. For now, Clark acts as regent until the teenage boy is found. Each passing day, the local wisconsinites grow their resentment and Mark's sanity decays."
 IEF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Artifically created out of an enclave occupied by the League of Nations, the International Expeditionary Force maintains a loose grip across central Illinois and Indiana. Walter Bedell Smith had once sided with the Federalists and even fought with the so called "Patriotic Legion of America." Once he realized how brutal all sides of the war had been, he realised that the only true way America can become whole again is from international assistance.  The local population resents the foreign presence and the Federalist and Socialists despises it even more. The ressurgence of the PLA is rumored to happen soon. Smith must carry on for the good of America."
 ERR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite their seemingly victory over the reds, the Federalist movement could not stop the collapse of the United States. MacArthur had been busy fighting the League of Nations to allow Federal forces to flee east. After being able to keep the League of Nations forces east of the Ohio River, MacArthur set up a provisional government and began an expedition through the Great Lakes. However, Red Guards attacking from Chicago cut off MacArthur’s men, leaving some trapped in Upper Michigan. MacArthur fled back to Erie, where he vowed to return to his cut off soldiers."
 KAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Before the Second American Civil War, Tom Pendergast was top dog of Kansas City. He was the Democratic Party's political machine and controlled essentially everything in the city. Although his corruption and influence scared many of the citizens, he would occasionally do good deeds for the people. When cracks started forming in President Thomas' grip on power, Pendergast took no hesitation to grab more power. With the taste of absolute authority, he grew more and more hungry for land and control. After all, why give up everything you gained just to hand it to the people?"
 WDC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "DeWitt was completely on board with Douglas MacArthur to rise up against the traitorous Norman Thomas. Although initally successful, the League of Nations intervened and caused the whole plan to fall into disarray. MacArthur made the ultimate sacrifice and threw all his forces to allow the rest of the army to retreat into the West. With no more contact with MacArthur, DeWitt had to lay down martial law to maintain the remaining states left in his control. Not everyone was satisfied however, many politicans defected and proclaimed DeWitt was a traitor to the US. Now, the WDC is a rump state that barely holds onto Salt Lake City and Denver."
  OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Beyond the many cities of America that are run by warlords, many rural areas have taken the opportunity for self-rule. The next few years will be a test to see whether they will be the cover image or the back pages of history books. \n\nPlease note that the only playable warlords are the ones listed. This is only a demo for the mod that is centered around the Great Lakes Region."
 ELK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Senator McCarran took it upon himself to deal with the socialist and communists as the Federalists seem to be disorganized. With no one at his side to support him in the Western Defence Command, he decided to take total control in his home state, Nevada. Being uncompromising with any socialists or loyalty to the federalists, McCarran found himself isolated with only the support of his fellow Nevadans and what little National Guard was left in Nevada. The only way to keep the United States stable is to remove the communist scum off american soil!"

 SRR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Lead by Lt. General James Doolittle, the remnants of the California National Army have held on despite all odds. Cut off by popular revolts in Arizona and Utah, and forced into Carson city by the West Coast Revolutionary Army. The remaining federalists were stuck between a rock and a hard place; desperate to hold the line at any cost, Sierra has employed its surviving aircraft to bomb any resistance they come across, be it military targets or civilian ones. This air campaign has not done the Route Army many favors, and Sierra has become nothing more then a pariah in the eyes of most Californians. But for the time being, they were alive."
 MIA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Created by the League of Nations’ intervention on the Eastern coast of the former United States, the Northern Mandate is hated by many of its inhabitants for being a puppet of European powers and is rocked by political and economic instability. As one of the largest remnants of the old U.S., the Northern Mandate has been crippled by the ongoing Great Depression, and the support it receives from Europe means it is plagued with unrest. The League has agreed to at last appoint an American to serve as President, though his undoubtedly limited powers means this decision is unlikely to moll over everyone." 

 CAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Even though the CMP initially controlled California, they were unable to fend off the invading Federalists and Southern raiders. As Sinclair’s power grip on the state diminished, senator Hiram Johnson launched a coup against the CMP, securing control over Sacramento. Declaring neutrality both towards the Socialist and Federalist movement, Johnson established relations with “friends” across the sea in the form of the Japanese Empire, establishing trade and diplomatic relations. However, this relationship might spell the demise of the golden state as Japanese power grows."
 EUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "At the time of the Second American Civil War, Upton Sinclair was the governor of California, defeating Frank Merriam with the help of the CMP. Cut off from the rest of the socialists, Sinclair was forced to defend the West Coast against political rivals and the federalists by himself. With overwhelming opposition, Governor Sinclair was forced to flee the state capitol and into the Central Valley. Now, Sinclair's clique has to finish his campaign promises he made years ago and needs to defend his people from the outside enemies."
 MJV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Al Capone was thrown in prison for tax evasion back in 1931. When all hell broke loose across America, Capone and his goonies made a daring escape off Alcatraz Island. With no warlord wanting to take in a blood-thirsty mob boss, Al Capone had no choose but to seek refuge in the unforgiving Mojave desert. With no natural resources and cut off from any associates, Capone must raid the nearby neighbors to keep an iron grip on his power."
 
 
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Blitzkrieg"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some new wars break out in Europe and Asia. Spain is now governed by nationalists and Japan has fought both the Soviet Union and China for territory, the latter being a more successful battle for Japan. The new non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany may be bad news for the rest of Europe."
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Great War still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely may very well be the way for France to avoid a disastrous war.\n\n France was victorious once before, this time shall be no different!"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Japan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Japanese control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while the Soviet Union is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia. \n\nWhen China's resources are in Japanese hands, the Soviets will be easy to deal with."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, achieved some fame as a peace keeper for his part in the Munich agreement a year ago. However, German territorial expansion has made Italy see there is more land to claim if an understanding with the Germans could be reached. \n\nAlbania has been conquered merely as a taste of Italy's military capabilities, and the rest of the world would do well to worry."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the west, German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" - and that the former German areas now under Polish control will be the first step to achieve it."
 CAN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Canada entered the Great War as a mere colony and left it as a nation. Born in the mud of Passchendaele, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage. \n\nHobbled by the Great Depression and with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this new nation looks anything but secure."
 AST_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War in blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipolli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, about to be drawn into yet another conflict in distant Europe, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"
 SAF_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The South African military spent most of the Great War chasing around German forces in their African colonies, with limited success. \n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in South Africa that think the country shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendants of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 NZL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualties in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the western front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the fighting overseas, and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of the Great War, the people of New Zealand look anxiously at the world stage, for this time, the threat of war seems to draw ever closer to their own home..."
 RAJ_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
 CZE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "During the Great War, Czech troops fought alongside the Entente forces all over Europe in an effort to secure recognition for their nation. Their efforts were successful and Czechoslovakia rose from the ashes of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. \n\nSince their explosive entry into statehood Czechoslovakia formed the 'Little Entente' alliance with Yugoslavia and Romania with the aim of suppressing Hungary's efforts to restore the Austro-Hungarian Empire, although as resurgent German power grows the political landscape of Europe is rapidly changing."
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "One half of the late Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary was treated as a defeated enemy by the victorious Entente after the Great War. In the Treaty of Trianon, the country lost almost two thirds of its territory. Millions of ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside its borders, and its economy was left in ruins. Harsh restrictions on rearmament were supposed to ensure that Hungary could never again threaten the peace in Europe. \n\nBut with the political climate in Europe shifting, the time may have come to finally right the wrongs of the past, and regain the former glory of the nation."
 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Romania found herself on the winning side of the Great War, and as a result gained new territories and people - not all of whom were Romanians. To guard against the revanchionist desires of the countries that were forced to cede land, Romania has created a web of alliances all across the Balkans. In recent years, however, the country has concerned itself mostly with domestic matters, and the government of King Carol II has allowed these alliances to lapse. \n\nAs the political situation in Europe changes, Romania may well find herself standing alone - and vulnerable."

 YUG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Yugoslavia came into existence after the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes merged with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia in 1922. Initially Yugoslavia joined both the Little Entente and the Balkan Pact to secure their independence, but recently the assassination of King Alexander combined with growing internal pressure from nationalists and external pressure from Italy and Germany has caused drastic upheaval and reevaluation of their political and strategic position."

 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the revolution that deposed the last of the Qing Emperors, the young Chinese Republic has struggled to survive. Warlords rule much of the land on the periphery. In the heart of the country, the Communists have set up a base area in a remote mountain valley. Just beyond the borders, the Japanese have created a puppet government under the last Chinese Emperor and will try to reunite the country under his rule.\n\nWith many enemies threatening it, the government of Chiang Kai-Shek will have to make hard choices if it wants to survive and rule supreme in China."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A mere two years ago, the Communist Party of China faced utter annihilation. To survive, it engaged on the epic journey that would become known as the Long March. With only a fraction of the army surviving the rigors of the march and little industry, the prospects of victory in the Chinese Civil War are slim indeed.\n\nBut in time, the population may be swayed to the Communist cause, new armies be raised, new base areas established, and, when the time is right, the revolutionary struggle will be renewed again, until final victory is achieved."
 CHI_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After two years of war against the Japanese, the armies of Chiang Kai-Shek have bled themselves white trying to stop the assault. The enemy has overrun the richest areas of the country. Little support has been forthcoming from the western democracies, and the Communist seem unwilling to engage the enemy in open battle.\n\nWith the war threatening to spread even further, it appears that the worst is still to come. But as the Japanese attack is slowed by the vastness of the country, they may well turn their gaze in other directions, and new alliances may yet turn the tide..."
 PRC_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Faced with an all-out Japanese attack, the Nationalists and Communists have struck an uneasy truce. Both sides are well aware that this United Front can not last. The Communist base area in Yan'an now forms the front line in the war against the Japanese.\n\nThe Communists must husband their resources carefully if they want to survive. Any casualties suffered in the fight against Japan will be felt twice over when the time comes to fight the war against the Nationalists, and this may well be what the government of Chiang Kai-Shek is counting on..."
 MAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Evicted from the Dragon Throne at the age of six, Puyi, the last Chinese Emperor, has been biding his time. While his former realm tore itself apart in the Chinese Civil War, Puyi found new allies in Japan.\n\nFor Puyi, the establishment of the Empire of Manchukuo in 1932 was but the first step in the quest to reclaim his ancestral birthright. For the moment, he is dependent on the Japanese Army to keep his rule, but in time, an opportunity might arise to cast off the shackles of servitude and become what he was born to be..."

 WARLORDS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The weakness of the Central Government may yet provide the opportunity for a sufficiently ambitious man to rise to power. At the periphery of the country, local leaders have carved out their own little fiefdoms, caring little for the orders of the Central Government. \n\nWar is on the horizon, and each of these Warlords faces a difficult choice: Collaboration with the Central Government or an alliance with the Communists? Either option promises a chance for a seat at the table, but there is a third possibility - to take China all for themselves."
 WARLORDS_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:1 "The war with Japan has forced the Chinese Warlords to pick a side, but there can be no doubt that this alliance is living on borrowed time. The day will come when it has outlived its usefullness, and on that day the game is once again open for every man ambitious and ruthless enough to make a play for the title of Ruler of China."
 MEXICO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Mexico faced two decades of civil wars after the overthrow of the tyrant Porfirio Díaz. Centralizers fought regionalists, peasants and socialists rallied against hacienda landlords, and battles over the role of state versus religion came out of the annals of the Enlightenment to terrorize Mexico.\n\nThe secularist government insists that it won these battles, but it is seated on a throne of debris. After Mexico is rebuilt, perhaps a different victor will have emerged."
 MEXICO_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The government of Lázaro Cárdenas has shown itself to be a bigger force for positive social change than that of his predecessor President Plutarco Calles, who has now been exiled to America. With the economic situation stabilized and the foreign oil firms brought under the custodianship of the state, the Mexican government can begin to look outwards. America faces enemies on many fronts and will likely forgive the nationalization of Standard Oil, but those enemies may be even more lucrative to befriend..."
 NETHERLANDS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Dutch government eyes the mounting global tensions with concern. Between an ailing economy, a powerful pacifist movement, and a firm belief in neutrality to the point of driving potential allies away, they are unable to properly prepare their defenses.\n\nAt the same time, the importance of the Netherlands as a gateway of trade into the continent means that both the British and the Germans desire Dutch 'cooperation' to thwart the other, and may take rejection as a reason for hostility. Perhaps withdrawal to the colonies is the only possible means to resist such an invasion..."
 NETHERLANDS_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War between Germany and the other European major powers seems inevitable, and though the Netherlands has put its faith once again in its neutrality, its leaders are contemplating making secret staff plans with their southern neighbors in preparation for possible hostilities.\n\nThe army has been mobilized, and work on the Dutch defensive lines is increasing in pace in an attempt to get the country as ready as possible to defend against any infringement of its sovereignty. Should this fail, there are always the colonies..."
 SPAIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the first five years of its existence, the fledgling Second Spanish Republic has already had to deal with strikes, a military coup attempt, and a major revolutionary uprising. Though it has survived these challenges, Spanish society continues to be marred by political polarization and violence between anarchists, communists, and falangists.\n\nBoth sides look towards the upcoming 1936 general election with hopeful eyes, but it is unlikely that the victory of either side will bring a return to stability. And as the violence continues, the military waits and plots..."
 SPAIN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The civil war that has devastated the country for the past three years has finally concluded. Under the guidance of Franco, the victors must now see to Spain's recovery, the elimination of remaining pockets of resistance, and the mending of the divides created by the war.\n\nTime is not unlimited, however, as the world at large continues its inexorable march towards what will undoubtedly be a far larger and still more bloody war. If Spain is to stand its ground, let alone reap the fruits of opportunity presented by this coming conflict, it must ready its industry and its military without delay."
 PORTUGAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since Salazar's rise to power in 1932, Portugal has been gradually distancing herself from the unstable period of the First Republic. Fiscal Autonomy and Political Independence from the major powers led to the creation of the Estado Novo, laying the foundations for the development of the Portuguese industry and the modernization of the army. \n\nNow, Portugal must decide the way forward as political and social instability increases in neighboring Spain and international tensions are hopelessly worsening..."
 PORTUGAL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The conservative government of Salazar allowed Portugal to remain neutral during the Spanish Civil War while actively supporting the Nationalists, thus ensuring the defeat of the Communists and the Anarchists. \n\nNow that the Iberian Peninsula has finally found stability, it is time to look abroad for potential allies and consider the role that Portugal will play on the seemingly inevitable world conflict."
