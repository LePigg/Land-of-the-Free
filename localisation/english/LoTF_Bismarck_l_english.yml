 bmk.1.t:0 "The Deep Plot"
 bmk.1.d:0 "Thomas’ ascension to the presidency struck horror into the hearts of businessmen nationwide. Many knew their fortunes would be confiscated and they feared they would suffer the same fate as the Kulaks in Soviet Russia. Capitalizing on this situation, Gerald MacGuire, an American Legionnaire, met with prominent business leaders to discuss plans to depose president Thomas and establish a military regime that would be friendly to business interests. MacGuire met with prominent Marine Smedley Butler, but little did he know that Butler was fully loyal to Thomas, and soon the plot was ratted out. Hundreds of businessmen tried to flee the country, but were quickly arrested. However, when MacArthur’s forces rose up, the remnants of the Plot organized into the ranks of the Federalists and soon helped coordinate corporate affairs in their war against socialism. Soon, when collapse seemed inevitable, MacGuire organized his loyal forces on a march west to escape the chaos of the East Coast Intervention, arriving in the plains of South Dakota. The local railway duopoly of Union Pacific and Burlington were more than happy to cooperate with the plot, and soon they had enough force to overthrow the socialist government of South Dakota to establish a provisional regime. Now their forces have uncontested rule of Sioux Falls, and while resistance continues throughout the countryside, the chokehold they have on the midwestern railway means their power will only continue to grow. The Plot’s goals are simple: the “restoration” of the capitalist American order and the utter annihilation of the socialist traitors."
 bmk.1.a:0 "The revolution will crumble like the pest it is!"
 bmk.2.t:0 "Dirty Money"
 bmk.2.d:0 "The sun was glaring down on the refugee line in front of the city hall in Estevan, Saskatchewan. RCMP Officer Edward Harrington had been stationed there ever since the outbreak of the Second American Civil War. Every week, at least 150 or so Americans would wander their way to the sleepy town. It wasn't hard work processing their arrival, but it was hard work breaking the news that not everyone can be accepted into Canada. Today was different though. Instead of raggedy families wandering around town, men in suits in a convoy of trucks were seen driving to various public buildings. Officer Harrington was the first to pull them over and see what was going on. They claim to be prominent business men from New York City who have been operating out of the Midwest for unspecified reasons. The reason why they visited is to buy weapons from Canada in exchange for wads of cash. Officer Harrington knew that the Canadian Government would never agree to trade with scumbag warlords, but the possibility of getting rich was just too hard to not pass. "I'll make a deal with you lads. A group of RCMP sent by me will go down to Grand Forks to drop off guns and whatever else you need. We require at least 1 million dollars per truckload of equipment for our troubles" Harrington explained. "It's a bit hard and pricey to get guns now considering what's going on down south, but I can assume you all are willing to take my offer.""

 bmk.4.d:0 "A large map of South Dakota was pinned to the wall. Several different colors shaded over regions of the map. Each representing which company will have complete control over where.

 bmk.5.t:0 "Conspiracy"
 bmk.5.d:0 "Robert Hansen worked enough as it is. Working in the St. Cloud Ironworks was hard, but it was a rewarding job. Thanks to labor unions and the Farmer-Labors, he earns a decent living and only needs to work eight hours a day, five days a week. All until the past three months. Three months since the State of Minnesota disintegrated and fell to the remnants of the Business Plot. Gone were the 35 minute lunch breaks. Gone were the days of earning 70 cents per hour. Ever since those filthy robber barons arrived in town, conditions have only deteriorated. Hansen couldn't take it anymore. Those democrats who had once smugly stayed in the Minnesota State Capitol had failed to protect him and these oligarchs even worse. Something in him began to fester. It was about time Hansen turned to a movement that really cared about him and workers..."

Many suggest that a civilian politican be "elected" as president instead of MacGuire as a sign of reform. The top candidate is a famous politican named Prescott Bush who has ties with Germany and France abroad. Of course, if he were to be in charge, he would have little to no power. In the end, the meeting ends with the decisions to..."

 bmk.21.t:0 "A Sweeter Drink"
 bmk.21.d:0 "Gerald MacGuire slumped in his chair. It has been a long and hard day of keeping the Executives in line and operating the land surrounding South Dakota. He glances to his side and notices something glimmering on the table: a soda bottle. For the life of him, MacGuire couldn't remember buying an soda that looked remotely like it maybe the housekeeper left it for him. How nice. "Pepsi," he chuckled as he saw the ridiculous bright white red and blue logo slapped on the middle. Why not give it a try he thought to himself as he reached into his pocket for his bottle opener. The cool dark brown syrupy drink slid down his throat and a sensational feeling started to grow in him. MacGuire started coughing and choking on the liquid and promptly hit the floor chest first. He could feel his body morphing and he screamed in pain and agony. The last thing he saw before leaving this world was a blur vision of a grey man standing in front of him. He couldn't believe it; it was Pepsi Man."
 bmk.21.a:0 "Pepsi Man will rule all"
 bmk.22.t:0 "Warring States"
 bmk.22.d:0 "Our military advisors and leader have unanimously agreed that now is the best time to expand into our neighbors' lands in order to secure our position much better. The war machine has been turned on once again for the better of our country."
 bmk.22.a:0 "One step closer to unification"
 bmk.23.t:0 "Deadly forces for Hire"
 bmk.23.d:0 "These few recent years have been paying the bills quite well for Joseph. Despite what his family and friends warned him, mercenary work has only garnered more wealth and excitement in his life. A new contractor from Sioux Falls, South Dakota has offered him millions of dollars to train some new conscripts in the warlord's army. Nothing too demanding, but damn was it the highest pay he had been given. To him, it didn't matter what the hell his contractors fought for or who they were fighting against. Afterall, he had served both the Socialists and Federalists as a field instructor. As long as he had a place to sleep and a brothel was nearby, Joseph was content."
 bmk.23.a:0 "Without a care in the world"
 bmk.24.t:0 "Back in Manhattan"
 bmk.24.d:0 "MacGuire could not believe what he was hearing. "What do you mean you will take NDA months to haul it all over? Do you know how much we pay you to do your damn job?!” He slumped backwards into his chair. The little stash of money that was brought along with MacGuire and friends was already nearly running out and these fools that still reside in New York City claim that transporting the rest of the loot will take half a year. "We need the money now or those bastards in Minneapolis will run us over like we are twigs!” Macguire muttered to himself. The other person on the phone nervously answered MacGuire's complaints. "We can try sending a smaller group out to deliver the cash. They most likely will take 3 months, but I would caution that they could be intercepted. It's your call Gerald.” MacGuire's head was starting to hurt. He put the phone back to his head and said "fine ..."
 bmk.24.a:0 "hurry up and just get here as soon as possible.""
 bmk.24.b:0 "take your time and make sure all of the cash gets here.""
 bmk.25.t:0 "Sob Stories from the East"
 bmk.25.d:0 ""Are you fucking serious!? You guys took three months and only brought a measly 15 million dollars?" MacGuire was about ready to send these bastards off to labor camp along with everyone else. "B-but sir, that was all we could manage to bring! Oh you should have seen them… the Commission would not let us pass through St. Louis without an entry fee… the Federalists in Iowa also seized a good chunk of our stash as well. Good men were killed helping us transport the money through the devilish Sioux south of here. You need to understand! We did the best we could." The man dropped to his knees along with his companions. MacGuire relented; afterall, he used to be in their shoes only a few years ago."
 bmk.25.a:0 ""This is your one time pardoning. Don't expect me to be this forgiving next time.""
 bmk.26.t:0 "Sob Stories from the East"
 bmk.26.d:0 ""Are you kidding me!? You guys pissed around for half a year just to deliver 15 million dollars? Do you know how much I pay you to do this?" MacGuire was about ready to send these bastards off to a labor camp along with everyone else. "B-but sir, that was all we could manage to bring! Oh you should have seen them… the Commission would not let us pass through St. Louis without an entry fee. We had to spend some of that money to hire escorts on our way there. If it weren't for them, we would have definitely been robbed in Iowa and South Dakota. You need to understand! We did the best we could." The man dropped to his knees along with his companions. MacGuire relented; afterall, he used to be in their shoes only a few years ago."
 bmk.26.a:0 ""At least you brough a decent amount of cash here. Thank you for your troubles.""
 bmk.27.t:0 "A Pact with the Business Plot"
 bmk.27.d:0 "With hell breaking loose around the Rust Belt, it is hard to keep track beyond our immediate dangers. Somehow, remnants of the obsecure Business Plot have managed to secure the MidWest. Diplomats from them have proposed a defensive pact with our government in order to expand our areas of control in the Great Lakes. With our strong ties to big buisness such as Ford, it only makes sense to continue to strengthen our cooperation with corporations; however, many politicans believe that we can not really on big business alone and that we can not trust them at all. In the end, Smith has the final say."
 bmk.27.a:0 "Join forces with Sioux Falls"
 bmk.27.b:0 "Refuse their offer"
 bmk.28.t:0 "Indianapolis Accepts Our Pact"
 bmk.28.d:0 "Gerald L. K. Smith has accepted our mutual defense pact proposal! This means that we are obligated to help each other in times of defensive war."
 bmk.28.a:0 "Wonderful!"
 bmk.29.t:0 "Indianapolis Refuses Our Pact"
 bmk.29.d:0 "Gerald L. K. Smith has rejected our mutual defense pact proposal! This means that we can not trust those fools and they will be seen as just another foe."
 bmk.29.a:0 "Smith will be crushed like the bug he is"
 bmk.30.t:0 "The Final Meeting"
 bmk.30.d:0 "The conference room was colder than usual. MacGuire and his bodyguard still had their black shades on despite being indoors. Arriving a few minutes late (as per usual), Gerald Smith and Lindbergh shuffled into the room. After about 15 minutes of small talk and discussion of war games, the fast cocking of a gun was heard. Nobody would knew who started it first, but soon a gun shootout rung out in the room. The battle was short one. In the end,"
 bmk.30.a:0 "Smith and Lindbergh are dead!"
 bmk.30.b:0 "The bodyguard is dead! Smith and Lindbergh escape unharmed!"
 bmk.31.t:0 "The Death of Grayson"
 bmk.31.d:0 "A businessman first and general second, Grayson M. P. Murphy has died from old age. An old ally of MacGuire, Murphy helped organize the business plot militias during the beginning of the civil war but his actual service record was nothing too extraordinary. More importantly, his fortunes have supposedly been dedicated to Gerald, meaning we have more funds to work with during our deals. The circumstances behind this have been something to raise an eyebrow at, but he additional funds will be beneficial to our cause. His funeral is to be held within the month."
 bmk.31.a:0 "So long, partner."
