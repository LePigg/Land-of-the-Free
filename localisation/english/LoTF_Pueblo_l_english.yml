#EVENTS
pbl.1.t:0 "True Freedom"
pbl.1.d:0 "At last, we are free from the tyrants in Salt Lake City. Enough is enough. The strict deadly curfews, the increasing invasions of privacy, the lack of care for the people. A group of true americans led by senator Edwin Johnson decided to rise up against the oppresion. The United States had died during the collapse, but they believed it could be easily revived under a new vision. The articles of confederation may have been too weak of a government to allow for any real progress yet the constitution bounded the states together too closely. A new draft of a constitution must be made to create a more perfect union. The states shall be free from government bonding yet they will be under a shared confederation. This will gurantee no person will ever be oppressed by the government again."

pbl.3.t:0 "Pueblo Extends the Olive Branch"
pbl.3.d:0 "Pueblo, the clear victor of the Rockies Skirmish, is offering us a place in their grand confederation. The deal is that we lay down our arms and join the state of Freedonia in exchange for prominent government positions. We either take the deal or face war."

 pbl.11.t:0 "The Trial of the Evil"
 pbl.11.d:0 "Governor Swickard knew the law of the American Land from those countless years of petitioning to become a state. These so called "Crimes Against Humanity" charged against him were meaningless. In his sick mind, he thought what he was doing what was right for his people when in reality, he has indirectly and directly killed hundreds if not thousands. By liquidating all of Absaroka's remaining assests, he has hired the finest and most professional lawyers to help him plead insanity to avoid the death penalty. The supreme court judges were continuously stumped as Swickard's lawyers presented loophole after loophole. In the end, Swickard escaped justice and has been found insane. Let this be a lesson that our Constitution must be revised and loophole-proof."
 pbl.11.a:0 "A hard lesson learned"
