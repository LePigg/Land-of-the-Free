err.1.t:0 "A Union, for Never?"
err.1.d:0 "The Federalist Movement is a name surrounded both by praise and hatred due to it's leader, Douglas MacArthur, the architect of the first coup in American history, whicgh ignited the nation’s 2nd Civil War following his attack upon the government of Norman Thomas. Through his leadership, MacArthur established the Mid Atlantic Federal Command center, acting as the central base of the Federalists receiving orders from DC. Although surrounded on both sides by Thomas’ Great Lakes Republic and socialist revolts in New England and NYC, MacArthur’s professional forces successfully won battle after battle against the poorly organized socialist militia. This all changed after the Soviet Intervention occurred, which with their guidance was Thomas able to begin to halt the Federal advance. The situation seemed bleak until a dispatch from London announced the legitimacy of MacArthur’s government, and promised to send aid in his war against Socialism. Although the Federals and League of Nations at first fought side by side during the East Coast Intervention, the Federal opinion of them shattered after the League began military occupation of American cities. MacArthur, in a fit of rage, ordered Federal forces to attack international armies, but this would be their downfall. With overwhelming League pressure, the movement, along with the United States, collapsed. But MacArthur wasn’t finished. With his few remaining loyal forces, he ordered a march into the Great Lakes with the occupied city of Pittsburg as the provisional capital as a forward base to prepare reclamation of America. However, on his mission, a socialist army leaving Chicago ambushed Federal forces. Far outnumbered, the Federals mounted a desperate defense, but were unable to hold back. MacArthur began a disorganized retreat across Ohio, but as a result, the 4th Army under George Grunert became trapped in Michigan. Their failure caused men of the Ohioan Army to defect from MacArthur and proclaim a rival regime in Columbus. Now controlling a rump state, the Federal Army is demoralized and tired of war, but MacArthur urges that once the internal threats are vanquished, the promise of American democracy will be fulfilled, and the Eagle will rise again, but as his powers grow more dictatorial by the day, can this really be true?."
err.1.a:0 "Our truth is marching on"
err.2.t:0 "MacArthur Requests the Constitution"
err.2.d:0 "Douglas MacArthur, who previously betrayed the League of Nation's trust, is now asking for the Constitution. We could easily just hand it to him since it has no value for the League of Nations; however, many in the government's inner circle are weary of MacArthur's motives and would rather keep the Constitution on display. Handing over the Constitution could artifically increase his legitamacy and hinder ours."
err.2.a:0 "Just hand it him"
err.2.b:0 "Why would we even think of doing something so stupid?"
err.3.t:0 "The Response from the Mid-Atlantic Administration"
err.3.d:0 "A convoy from the League of Nations has dropped off the Constitution in a wooden box. After checking for traps, the Constitution now is safely displayed in the center of the Erie City Hall. Surely, the people in our lands will start to have confidence in us now that we have one of the most valuable pieces of the United States."
err.3.a:0 "Great news!"
err.4.t:0 "A New President?"
err.4.d:0 "Now that rule has been officially established over our lands, we should figure out who should be the head of state. Should MacArthur continue acting as an American Cincinnatus and step down when the whole country is liberated or should he step down as acting president? In the end, he decides to..."
err.4.a:0 "Continue as acting president"
err.4.b:0 "Relinquish power to the Republican Party"
err.4.c:0 "Relinquish power to the Democratic Party"
err.5.t:0 "A Message to the WDC"
err.5.d:0 "A message written in a letter has been sent from MacArthur to DeWitt. Nobody knows what it says except MacArthur himself. The soldiers that are transporting this message only assume it is for establishing contact as they try to reunite the nation under a single banner. Hopefully this letter will keep the light of the union aflame in the west."
err.5.a:0 "The Union still lives on"
err.6.t:0 "Meeting with the Governors"
err.6.d:0 "Govenors Davey and Earle waited patiently in the war room. Suddenly, MacArthur enteres the room. He has decided to give the power of restructing the economy to both governors. They will work together to create a plan to get this piece of American back up on its feet before the others do."
err.6.a:0 "Godspeed"
err.7.t:0 "The Race for Ohio"
err.7.d:0 "Information has spread that the federals have entered Ohio. It would be stupid to aid the traitors that once sent the national guard after us. The only way to stop the federals from completely taking over Ohio is for us to take it before they do."
err.7.a:0 "Now or never"
err.8.t:0 "Homecoming"
err.8.d:0 "Lieutenant Eugene and his company swiftly bust down the door of the old textile mill. Those traitorous Socialists must be hiding in there. He began to scan the room. Empty bullet casings and bean cans were scattered all over the place. Someone has been holding out there for a long time. Just then, a group of men jumped out behind a generator with their hands up. Eugene noticed something. These men aren’t the usually ragtag Socialists that he usually fought against. They were wearing the same helmets and coats that he was wearing. He couldn’t believe it. Could these men be remnants of the 4th Army? The men dropped to their knees and cried tears of joy. The 4th Army has finally returned back home."
err.8.a:0 "Welcome back General Grunert"
 err.9.t:0 "From: Pittsburgh, Extending the Olive Branch"
 err.9.d:0 "The so-called 'Erie Republic' has asked our government for the opportunity to unite our two nations and stand as one. We share the same goal of saving the United States yet MacArthur's vision of democracy for the future remains uncertain. In addition, they are also notorious for supoorting the Iowa Detachment. Should we accept this offer or should we take out these traitors?"

 err.11.a:0 "They forced our hand"
 err.12.t:0 "A New Capital?"
 err.12.d:0 "Now that all enemies have been squashed and destroyed, we can finally let our guard down a little and transition to a less militaristic government. The first question raised is whether to keep Pittsburgh the capital of our emergency govenrment or to move our capital somewhere else. Some suggest that we move our capital to Chicago, the original base for the socialists, to be strategic position which is in the middle of our controlled lands. Others say that it should be moved to Minneapolis, home of democracy, as a gesture of good will that the old order will return. The last option is to keep our capital in Pittsburgh as to not spend our precious money on such trivial things such as moving capitals. In the end, our government decides to..."

 err.13.d:0 "It was the fifth night that MacArthur's personal room still was lit up with lights during the middle of the night. Not even his door guards or closest advisors are sure what he has been up to this past week. MacArthur, tired of what seems like countless nights of proofreading his speech. "Is this really for the best?" MacArthur thought to himself. There was no time or reason to second-guess himself. Democracy must return to the United States of America or it would never return to the glory days. After all, the Constitution does not allow for the suspension of elections. Was MacArthur's righteous rebellion against the traitorous Ex-president Norman Thomas unconstitutional? It doesn't matter now. All that matters is that the old republic has returned."

Not even his door guards or closest advisors are sure what he has been up to this past week. MacArthur, tired of what seems like countless nights of proofreading his speech. "Is this really for the best?" MacArthur thought to himself. There was no time or reason to second-guess himself. A weak and unstable democratic government mustn't return to the United States of America or it will shatter once again. The Union requires a strong military government to hold its rowdy people and politics together. Then again, would have the democratic process removed Norman Thomas as President? It doesn't matter now. All that matters is that the old republic has returned."
 err.15.a:0 "The Union Forever"
 err.16.t:0 "In a Show of Loyalty"
 err.16.d:0 ""I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all." It was an executive order sent out by MacArthur for the posting of the Oath to be required in each public building. It truly is a test of loyalty of all citizens. Those who are suspected of treasonous actions will now have to face the death penalty for violating the Pledge of Alligence."
 err.16.a:0 "Hail to the chief"
 err.17.t:0 "American Consul"
 err.17.d:0 "Although the United States of America needs a strong centralized government, there must not be a sole person ruling above all. Afterall, isn't that what we Americans fought against during the American Revolution? But who could be trusted with such high authority along with MacArthur? The only valid option is the loyal generals that have stuck with MacArthur all these years and fought along his side. Eisenhower and Harding do deserve to have their voices heard in the government. The executive branch will be primarily composed of a group of military generals instead of a sole president."
 err.17.a:0 "Several heads is better than one"
 err.18.t:0 "Infinite Terms"
 err.18.d:0 "From the mistakes of the Articles of Confederation, the Founding Fathers purposely wanted a strong executive branch that would oversee all internal affairs. MacArthur can really trust no one else but himself to take up this task. Too many times has his closest allies and friends betrayed him and the Union. It is only up to him and him only to guide the United States of America to become one again. All that matters is that the United States of America becomes whole again no matter the cost."

 err.21.d:0 "In front of MacArthur were Generals Leo Kreber and Daniel van Voorhis: knees on the ground, hands tied behind their back, and potato sacks over their heads. MacArthur abruptly removed the bags and the bright afternoon sun pierced their eyes. General Kreber looked around. Dozens of Federalist soldiers had their rifles pointed at him with Eisenhower and MacArthur standing behind them. He knew death was imminent. “I-I-I can explain!

Beightler held our families hostage and if we stepped out of line, who knows what would happen! Please, you must…” Kreber kept rambling on and on until his words turned into sobbing. MacArthur was emotionless behind his aviator sunglasses. What do these traitors expect? Clemency? Then again, we do need all the help we can get. Also, forgiving Kreber and van Voorhis is a lot easier than forgiving Norman and his goonies. Once Kreber’s sobbing turned to wimpers, MacArthur finally spoke:"

 err.23.t:0 "Victory at Last"
 err.23.d:0 "MacArthur’s heart had been racing after the 3rd assault upon the Red Menace. His coup had failed. The Steel belt expedition had failed. But now, he could feel it. After years of bloodshed, MacArthur had reached the heart of the traitors, Chicago. “This is it men, we must fight, fight with every inch of your being!” MacArthur ordered. The socialists had been attempting scorched Earth tactics to try and stall the Federal assault for as long as possible, but their unprofessional militias were becoming increasingly unable to resist the Federalist advance. The men of Chicago resisted for as long as they could, blowing up railways and setting fire to buildings, but as mutinies and defeatism began to take hold, any resistance melted away as Federal troops reached the Chicago capitol. MacArthur personally had led the assault on the Red Stronghold, but by the time the building was taken, it was empty, as CMP officials began to order surrenders throughout the red palace. Federal troops stormed the building, searching for any CMP officials and arresting them. After clearing out the basement, Norman Thomas, the last president of the United States, was taking cover within the basement. Near him lay the corpse of Earl Browder with a bullethole in his forehead and gun near his hand; it was likely that he had commit suicide to evade capture by the Federal forces. Norman’s personal guards stood down in response to Federal infantry aim their guns at them, and Norman Thomas was hauled off without any resistance. In a mock trial held in Cleveland, Norman Thomas was found guilty of war crimes, treason, and violation of the constitution, sentenced to death. He was placed into the electric chair, mumbling to himself. As the executioner placed his hand on the lever, Thomas spoke one last time. “All I ever wanted was an America truly free, true to its ideal, free from both internal and external oppression. But if this is not what the American people want, so be it. I can only pray God will forgive us all, and perhaps one day, you will all realize the truth”. The lightning flash, and the last President violently jolted, before falling limp. The reign of the Reds was over."
 err.23.a:0 "We have made the founding fathers proud"
 err.24.t:0 "Those Who Plead No Contest"
 err.24.d:0 "The so-called "American Redemption Authority" has been squashed like the cockroaches they are. They claim that they are the only ones able to "revitalize" the United States and that our Federalist movement is too weak to destroy the Socialists. Lindbergh’s body was found in a collapsed military tent outside Terre Haute with a bullet through his skull and a gun in his hand. Gerald Smith was nowhere to be seen, presumptuously buried in a mass grave. The same couldn’t be true for their trusted generals. All three prominent generals are guilty of subversive activities and helping the fascists in Indianapolis, but could be extremely helpful in our fight against the Socialists. Many officers are already angry with MacArthur for even considering pardoning a group of rebels, yet some call it pragmatic to spare them. Can they be trusted even after we waged war with them? In the end, MacArthur decides…"
 err.24.a:0 "To make them targets at a shooting range"
 err.24.b:0 "Join the ranks with strict supervision"
 err.25.t:0 "Fairytale Land"
 err.25.d:0 "General Eisenhower was beyond disgusted. The man who was once one of his closest friends had gone and betrayed him. General Mark Clark was steadfast in keeping his 5th Army from joining the Federalist Movement. There is no sanity left in Clark if he still thinks a monarchy would be better over our righteous Federalists' cause or the wicked Socialists. Now, the fool stands blindfolded against a wooden pole. Guns and bayonets pointed at him from 10 yards away. There is no dignity to be saved. Traitors always get what they deserve. “Any last words royal regent?” one of the firing squad members sneered. “So pathetic. Where is your king?” Clark continued to stay silent. A few seconds later, the cracking of guns firing rang out across the Wisconsin plains."
 err.25.a:0 "Not even a word"
 err.27.t:0 "Request for the Constitution Rejected!"
 err.27.d:0 "As a surprise to no one, the International Congress has denied our request for the Constitution. The only way to obtain this vital piece of history is to steal it.
