DIX.1.t:0 "The Capital Speech"
DIX.1.d:0 "After over a month of planning and ensurement of total security for the governor, Bilbo prepared to appear in public for the first time since taking office to deliver a speech to the citizens of Austin. He marched up to the podium, wearing his staple white suit and hat, and took a deep breath before starting. “My fellow countrymen, today we have gathered in this very square in time of uncertainty and fear. The poison of communism has brought our once beloved nation to its knees into the depths of mongrelism and degeneracy. I have witnessed it with my own eyes; the reds took my home state of Mississippi right in front of my very eyes. These scum of the earth wish to see the white race subjugated, subordinated to the inferior races”. A collective murmur arose from the crowd. “The brave white Americans of Texas now face the same threat, all around us, the creeping terror of the tyrants that once sat in the Oval Office stripping us all of our constitutional rights. A plot builds in the shadow against our race, built up by the bankers and communists which control our lives. But today, I, Theodore Bilbo, shall declare this shall be tolerated no longer! Their slander seeks to strip us of our culture, labeling us as traitors for speaking out while negro blood creeps into our pure society. But no greater treason exists as these degenerate practices that seek to separate America from the lord and into damnation. Today citizens, we take up arms, against the traitors, against the communists, against the mongrels, and for America!” As he finished, the crowd burst into cheers, ready to take up arms for the old order."

DIX.3.t:0 "Reviewing War Plan White"
DIX.3.d:0 "War Plan White was a contingency plan employed by the Federalists but created before the civil war to crush an organized rebellion within the nation. A few of the original projects were used in the Texan Military Administration, and with Walker’s defection, some of the plans are now in our hands. Despite the fact that we managed to secure the capital of Texas, our army stands completely surrounded by hostile forces. High Command has convened to discuss how War Plan White should be used so that we may quickly win this civil war."

DIX.9.t:0 "The Convoys"
DIX.9.d:0 "The old and near brittle soldier stared at the foggy river, looking through a rusted pair of binoculars to make out the shapes almost out of sight. It wasn't unusual seeing ships on the Mississippi but something about the ships had put him off, this was a spot where he regularly relaxed during his time off, and, never, ever, had any ship come into view.\nNow, of course border skirmishes or battles were common but from what he could tell there were no armaments on these ships, it was unsettling to imagine what the ships could be used for, he slung his binoculars to his side and shook his head, there's nothing good about to happen. \nAs the days past he began to realize what he reported to his superior commander was more than he could ever imagine, whether it was the artillery shell that killed him, or rather the negligence of his superior officer or, maybe perhaps the smallest bit of hope that the shapes that he observed were going to perhaps be a diplomatic envoy, or perhaps trade between two brotherly, and civil warlords. Little did anyone know those ships had one purpose and one purpose only; Death."

DIX.11.t:0 "Dealing with the Oklahoma Tribes"
DIX.11.d:0 "Although Alfalfa Bill’s Oklahoma was the perfect example of a pure state in practice, he took the idea of Confederation very seriously. Despite some squabbles, his state had given a fair amount of autonomy to the various Indian tribes within Oklahoma, allowing them to run their own towns and use their own laws. This kept them docile for Bill, and we realize that stripping their autonomy would cause unnecessary conflict. The status quo is preferable, however, the alternative of pushing for assimilation to bring white civilization to these tribes is a more controversial but yet discussed plan. "

DIX.13.a:0 "We shall rule the waves once more!"
DIX.14.t:0 "Dealing with the Silver Shirts"
DIX.14.d:0 "Although the Silver Shirts understood the supremacy of the white race, their fanatical principles and commitment to totalitarianism made them unopen to reason and as a result, we had to crush them. Pelley has been detained and locked up in an insane asylum, despite his threats that he would simply “phase through the wall” and escape. With this nutjob out of the way, we now need to deal with the more reasonable lot of his clique. A few members within our government, mainly Klansmen, have suggested we offer clemency to former Silver Shirts and allow them to join our ranks, as they were shining examples of purity and devotion to “smiting degeneracy”. However, more moderate members such as the Democrats have ruled that they are still convicted of treason and supporters of tyranny, and to lock them up is the right thing to do."

DIX.19.t:0 "Edwin Walker Defects!"
DIX.19.d:0 "General Edwin Walker, the former leader of the Texan Military Administration, has just been detained at a military checkpoint on our border with TMA controlled territory. Walker was not accompanied by any guards, and has declared his intention to fight for our government, believing [TEX.GetNameDef] to be a lost cause and that only the Confederacy can save Texas now. While there are some in our government who are distrustful of the man who was, until very recently, the figurehead representing all we oppose, his martial skill necessitates that we accept his offer."
DIX.19.a:0 "Welcome home, Walker!"
