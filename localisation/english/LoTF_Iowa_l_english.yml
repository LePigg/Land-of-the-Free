 iwa.1.t:0 "An Exile Republic"
 iwa.1.d:0 "In the midst of the Second American Civil War, MacNider’s army was ordered by MacArthur to assist him destroy the Socialists in Chicago once and for all. Tried as they might, they could not cross the Mississippi River and secure a foothold. With MacNider’s failure to launch a successful offensive, MacArthur’s army was split into two and the Federalist movement disintegrated along with the Socialists. With the guilt of failure on MacNider’s mind, he swears to redeem himself in the name of the Federalist movement one way or another. With no means of contact between any other Federalist army, MacNider was forced to stay in the lands of Iowa and Northern Missouri. Not everyone is happy with the Federalists occupying the lands. When the local government was kicked out and martial law was put into effect, seeds of dissent began to grow. It has been a few years now since the Federalists have taken power and dissent has turned into a planned rebellion. The former governor, Clyde L. Herring, is the main opposition to the Federalists hoping to return democracy and normalcy to Iowa."
 iwa.1.a:0 "Loyalty to the state or the country?"
 iwa.2.t:0 "The Breaking Point"
 iwa.2.d:0 "There is no point in lying. The democratic opposition has been growing ever since MacNider and his Federalist army took over in Iowa. Clyde L. Herring, the Democratic Party governor before MacNider, has offered a solution to this issue. He suggests reopening the state senate and allowing the people to have a say in the government. Although this would definitely decrease discontent state-wide, we could slowly lose our grip on power. In the end, we must make a choice as protests become increasingly common. Do we put our trust into the people or our army?"
 iwa.2.a:0 "The people can be trusted!"
 iwa.2.b:0 "The army knows best!"
 iwa.3.t:0 "Friends Up North"
 iwa.3.d:0 "Governor Herring was no ally for MacNider; he absolutely hated that despot’s guts. Cooperating with the tyrant for now is what is best for Iowa. When the time is right, the democratic rebels led by Herring will stab him in the back. For now, Herring must make contact with some outside help. He could always rely on his good friend Governor Olson of Minnesota. Surely, he will be willing to help fund our cause and perhaps train our militias."
 iwa.3.a:0 "No turning back now"
 iwa.4.t:0 "Now or Never"
 iwa.4.d:0 "Herring gathering with his most trusted allies otside the state capitol. Today was going to be the day that Iowa returns back to iowans. The Federalist will have to bend to us! When Herring and the student protestors stormed into the state senate, the Federalist faction that usually overlooks sessions were nowhere to be found. Suddenly, shots rang out through the building and chaos soon ensued. In the end, Governor Herring was just lucky to make it out alive. It seems like Federalists have anticipated our attempted coup. There's no turning back. We must secure a better future for Iowa even if it means going to war with the Federalists!"
 iwa.4.a:0 "Secure all the land we can!"
 iwa.5.t:0 "Long Way from Des Moines"
 iwa.5.d:0 "Herring booked it anywhere out of Des Moines as the Federalists have shot to kill orders for him and his supporters. Outside of Des Moines is the vast countryside that Herring can hide in. Now in the Missouri city of Columbia, he must launch his democratic revolution from out of state."
 iwa.5.a:0 "We do what we must!"
 iwa.5.b:0 "We will kill that rat bastard!"
 iwa.6.t:0 "Chicago's Revenge"
 iwa.6.d:0 "It seems like our past actions have come to bite us in the ass. Chicago has sent multiple divisons and one their own trusted generals across the Mississippi River. They currently occupy the riverside cities of Dubuque and Davenport. They claim that the workers have started their own revolution and Chicago is only assisting them."
 iwa.6.a:0 "We all know damn well they staged this!"
 iwa.6.b:0 "Off to Dubuque!"
 iwa.7.t:0 "Hardly Anything"
 iwa.7.d:0 "MacNider knew that he must give some slack to the iowans or tensions boil over. Afterall, they deserve to be relieved of martial law after all these years. For this monumental event, MacNider will personally talk to a large crowd in front of the state capitol. Unfortunately, it seemed like the democratic rebels would rather stab us in the back instead of working with us. During the middle of the speech, someone in the crowd lobbed a grenade onto the stage. Luckily, one of the guards was able to grab it and chuck it back into the general direction of where it came from. Chaos ensued as the crowd dispersed and gunshots rung out in the open field. Governor Herring has called MacNider a despot and that he had betrayed the iowan people. After a few days, the democratic rebels went radio silent."
 iwa.7.a:0 "Where did they go?"
 iwa.8.t:0 "Golden Opportunity"
 iwa.8.d:0 "The bastards in Iowa that once tried destroying us has seemed to have fallen apart. This could be a perfect opportunity to export the revolution beyond the gates of Chicago. We must send in a detachment of our army and generals and turn Iowa red."
 iwa.8.a:0 "Make it seem like the local miners started a rebellion."
 iwa.8.b:0 "Duty calls in Dubuque."
 iwa.9.t:0 "The Status Quo"
 iwa.9.d:0 "Diplomacy can't be used to settle disagreements with such barbaric people like Langer. Now that the North Dakotans have been defeated, we must decided what their fate will be. MacNider suggests that the status quo from before the Second American Civil War be maintained. Let's just execute the traitors and take their place."
 iwa.9.a:0 "What the hell was Langer thinking?"
 iwa.10.t:0 "Winning Them Over"
 iwa.10.d:0 "Perhaps there is some lead way we can give to Langer. If we leave him alone, maybe the North Dakotans would not mind our administration watching over them. For now, let's just give Langer some minimal liberties to do what he wants."
 iwa.10.a:0 "Better than having them riot"
 iwa.11.t:0 "The Trial of the Minnesota Government"
 iwa.11.d:0 "According the Constitution, treason can be punishable by death. The traitors that ran the state of Minnesota have defied orders by declaring independence and now must face the consequences. It is a shame. Those politicans all had potential."
 iwa.11.a:0 "Down with the traitors, up with the stars"
 iwa.12.t:0 "A Free Iowa"
 iwa.12.d:0 "Herring can't believe it. Despite the Socialists and Federalists, Iowa has remained a free state. It is time that Minnesota and Iowa join forces to remove these traitors of the United States off the face of this Earth. We can't stop now either. There are enemies surrounding us and we must get back to work."
 iwa.12.a:0 "Quite the turn of events"
 iwa.13.t:0 "Minneapolis Equipment Arrives"
 iwa.13.d:0 "Despite all the chaos, we can always trust our friends in Minneapolis. Luckily, a convoy from them have arrived with truckfulls of primary firearms."
 iwa.13.a:0 "Wonderful!"
 iwa.14.t:0 "The Long Journey"
 iwa.14.d:0 "Eisenhower jumped off the dinghy and onto solid ground. It had been about probably three weeks since those traitors captured Erie and killed General MacArthur. Traveling through the Ohio River and into the Mississippi had been a grueling journey that many of his own guards had to sacrifice their life for. Was it justified to abandon MacArthur? There was nothing Eisenhower could have done but flee; afterall, Harding and Griswold went with him. Just as the thoughts of betrayal ran through his head, a couple of Federalist river garrisons ran towards the group with their firearms raised. "Lower your weapons soldiers. There is not much time left. I must speak to MacNider immediately," Eisenhower said in a tired voice. Recognizing the handful of generals and armed guards in tattered Federalist outfits, the Iowa officer spoke into his radio: "Call MacNider immediately. We have some unexpected guests.""
 iwa.14.a:0 "I'll take it from here"
 iwa.15.t:0 "The Fall of Minneapolis"
 iwa.15.d:0 "Governor Herring's hands began to tremble, barely able to take his glasses off. The Minneapolis has fallen to the enemy. Democracy was no more once again in another state. Herring had worked so hard to align Iowa with the Minnesotan cause only to be left standing alone. Herring looked up towards the ceiling and cleared his throat. He must continue on carrying the torch of liberty and democracy no matter the circumstance."
 iwa.15.a:0 "Democracy never dies"
 iwa.16.t:0 "A Long Awaited Annoucement"
 iwa.16.d:0 "MacNider was estatic to finally pick up the red phone. It had been years since he was able to bring good news to MacArthur. With the entire midwest region secured, MacNider and his army is ready to reunite with MacArthur and the rest of the gang in Erie. In order to do this, we must cross the Mississippi and destroy all adversaries between us and MacArthur. The end of the tunnel is getting closer. The Federalist Movement shall triumph above all!"
 iwa.16.a:0 "Across the Mississippi!"
 iwa.17.t:0 "The Long Awaited Telephone Call"
 iwa.17.d:0 "Hello? Yes this is MacArthur. \nMacNider? \nWhat is going on in Iow-\n...\nReally now? All dead? \n...\nWell shit! We need to connect forces ASAP! \nGodspeed MacNider!"
 iwa.17.a:0 "Finally some good news for once!"
 iwa.18.t:0 "The Final Redemption"
 iwa.18.d:0 "The last time MacNider had met MacArthur in person was back in 1932. Now, he stands with MacArthur at the provisional capital. MacArthur put his scarred hand on MacNider's right shoulder and a proud smile grew on his face. "I hearby promote Hanford MacNider to the position of a four star general," MacArthur boomed in front of the watching crowd. Shortly after a medal was placed on MacNider's neck, the crowd errupted into a massive applause."
 iwa.18.a:0 "At ease, MacNider"
 DBQ.1.t:0 "Assuming Control"
 DBQ.1.d:0 "News has arrived from the central capital: President Thomas is dead. He was captured by one of the forces of the reactionary armies in the Great Lakes, and although our comrades tried as hard as they could, Chicago has fallen. Devers is a soldier first, and he was hoping that the revolution would not be left in his hands, but it appears it is not his choice to make. Exiled socialist activists have poured into the border, establishing an exile government. Some remnants of the Chicagan military have joined us as well alongside officer Shoup and Heitke. Devers now temporarily represents the CMP in exile, and has promised to restore civil governance once the Great Lakes have been pacified."
 DBQ.1.a:0 "It is our duty."
 DBQ.2.t:0 "Delegation from Dubuque"
 DBQ.2.d:0 "Jacob Devers sat across the border of Minnesota. His mission in Iowa was complete, and now he was expected from the Chicago government to continue the mission across the rest of the midwest. However, the feelings of loyalty began to waver. Devers had some sympathies for the plight of the workers during the depression, but he mainly sided with Thomas due to his legitimacy of being the elected president. However, a new city on the hill lay before him. The people of Minneapolis had rebuilt democracy, bringing America closer to its old ideals. He thought to himself that perhaps the true pathway to rebuilding the nation would be within the state. However, this action would be full treason: the men within this city betrayed Thomas during the civil war. Trying to work with them without direct orders would surely be a dangerous ploy. Devers has decided to commence a session in the capital of Minnesota to discuss terms with Floyd Olson on the prospect of our forces joining the men of Minnesota: this will be treason against the Chicago government, but it could prevent the spilling of more blood. After a long meeting, Devers decides to..."
 DBQ.2.a:0 "To prevent the spilling of more blood."
 DBQ.2.b:0 "Affirm loyalty to the president." 
 DBQ.3.t:0 "Failed Summit"
 DBQ.3.d:0 "Despite the talks of peaceful integration, Devers has turned back, affirming his loyalty to the true President of America. Although war between our two states has not erupted, an uneasy peace is in effect, ready to crumble at any time."
 DBQ.3.a:0 "The revolution continues."
 DBQ.4.t:0 "A Strange Offer"
 DBQ.4.d:0 "A sudden change in policy has occurred in the socialist ranks. Their new leader Jacob Devers is a man of West Point, and willing to strike a deal with us. The socialists will cease their siege of the city and will spare our men from charges of treason. On top of that, our officers will be allowed to enlist in the Red Army. We are tired of war and want peace, but can we really accept it from the damned Reds?"
 DBQ.4.a:0 "No use in resisting it."
 DBQ.4.b:0 "Come and take it!"
 DBQ.5.t:0 "Unfortunate News"
 DBQ.5.d:0 "The damn Federalists are stubbornly holding onto their rump state in Michigan and have refused peace. They will be destroyed swiftly."
 DBQ.5.a:0 "Onwards!"
 DBQ.6.t:0 "Face Justice"
 DBQ.6.d:0 "Gerald MacGuire was frantically running about his office. He knew what was coming. The socialists who he painted as subhumans unable to resist the “true will of America” were now within his capital. Most of his business partners fled to Canada first chance they could, but he was unable to escape. The gunshots were getting louder. He quickly went through his piles of gold, silver, and dollars. Surely, any wise man would accept the bribe; in exchange for richies unrivaled by many he would run a free man. Suddenly, a detachment stormed the room. Gerald turned to them, and in a voice of sheer terror, began to plead. “Please! Anything! I’ll give you anything! Millions of dollars, rich enough for you to leave this god forsaken fucking country and start a new life! Free from warlordism! Free from socialist scum! Free from the jewi-” before he could finish, the officer knocked him out with his baton, dragging his limp body out of the room. With the surrender of the forces of Bismarck, the trial of Gerald and his businessmen who had tormented the poor men of America began. Accused of a massive list of heinous crimes, they were all sentenced to death by electric chair. With the bourgeoisie gone, we have begun to nationalize the industry of their former corporate empire."
 DBQ.6.a:0 "We have broken the chains."
 DBQ.7.t:0 "Dubuque Threatens Us!"
 DBQ.7.d:0 "why are you playing north dakota bro"
 DBQ.7.a:0 "fine ill play dubuque"
 DBQ.7.b:0 "langer gang 4 life!!!!!"
 DBQ.8.t:0 "Former Foes"
 DBQ.8.d:0 "After the total collapse of the Democrats during the Iowan Civil War, we have successfully apprehended their high command. Their forces created the catalyst we needed to begin our revolution, and they fought to overthrow the tyranny of the Federal regime. They fought for freedom and were willing to resist with every inch of their being the forces of what they viewed to be oppression. Close party members have wanted them punished equally as were the Federalists, but as Dever’s expeditionary force holds the true authority in our regime their fate is up to him. The bravery they showed during the war earned Dever’s respects, and he is willing to spare them. Believing that the socialist army is in desperate need of further reforms, Devers has decided that they will be allowed to be let back into the ranks in order to step closer to not only rebuilding the state in the wake of the war but for the future of the revolution."
 DBQ.8.a:0 "Your bravery has not gone unnoticed."
