 lac.1.d:0 "Technocracy has been the rave in California. The Great Collapse has shown Californians how the old order has failed to serve the people. Howard Scott had an unusual solution. Instead of the corrupt and incompetent politicans from Washington, smart and capable scientists will decide what is the best for the people. Not all are satisfied with the technocrats in power. Aldous Huxley, a notable English author residing in Los Angeles, is the leading opposition leader. For now, he will have to lay low until the time is ripe."
