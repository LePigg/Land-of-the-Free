lak.1.t:0 "A Conspiracy Underneath"
lak.1.d:0 "Northern Wyoming has been extremely silent for the past few months. Now we know the truth. A. R. Swickward has been starting a rebellion against our government citing our brutality and oppression. They have created a new state and race of "Absarokans" that they claim is above all. We must crush this petty insurgency."
lak.1.a:0 "Another day, another problem"
lak.1.b:0 "The rebellion has begun! Rally our men!"
lak.2.t:0 "The Unimaginable"
lak.2.d:0 "We have control of almost all our ancestor lands. It is all thanks to our brave soldiers for occupying new lands and repelling the Western Defence Command from Wyoming and Montana. Inner governmental conflict has kept our region unstable as we have to figure out what to do with the majority white population living in our lands. Because we seem to be only successful open rebellion against our white oppressors, it is our moral duty to liberate all native americans."
lak.2.a:0 "No matter how hidden a force is, it will attract some kind of resistance"
lak.3.t:0 "The All-Native Conference"
lak.3.d:0 "In the conference stands two major factions: the absolutionists and the unionists. The absolutionists faction led by the current leader, One Bull, wish to avenge all of the wrongdoings of the americans and to create a confederation of Native Americans. A new social hierarchy will have an enforced affirmative action for minority groups, specifically Native Americans. The unionists are led by a young musician named William Horn Cloud. Contrary to the absolutionists, the unionists wish to create an equal confederacy of all races with an emphasis of justice for the natives. At the end of the talks, all local tribes will have voted to elect a faction as the face of the Lakotah Government. In the end, the faction that recieved the most votes was..."
lak.3.a:0 "The absolutionists"
lak.3.b:0 "The unionists"
lak.4.t:0 "The Legacy of the USA"
lak.4.d:0 "It is obvious that the americans have not treated our people kindly to say the least. We will never forget or forgive the Wounded Knee Massacre, but the americans have brought us great utilities. The cavalry milita that we have taught ourselves how to use properly has outsmarted their formal armies. In addition, the leftover piles of guns have been a major upgrade to our centuries old technique of bow and arrow. Even now, we still learn lessons from their technology. Realistically, we have no chance of vanquishing our enemies head on, we must act as hidden forces and attack them when they are unaware. This will require extensive planning for our plan to work out perfectly."
lak.4.a:0 "Just like the americans in 1776"
lak.5.t:0 "Appeasing the Moderates"
lak.5.d:0 "There is no denying that there is a large chunk of white and native population that wish for mere coexistence. It has been hotly debated whether a seperate territory should be divided to allow an independently run colony for the white population to ease the worry of public. Many of the Lakotah worry for another uprising after the traumatic rebellion of the Absarokans though the benefits may outweigh the negatives."
lak.5.a:0 "An autonomous zone wouldn't hurt"
lak.5.b:0 "We are too vulnerable to afford local freedoms"
lak.6.t:0 "Rethinking Our End Goal"
lak.6.d:0 "It is very blatant that white americans have not treated us well at all. There is a considerable population of mormons living in Utah and nearby tribes. They may be white americans, but they seem to have solidarity in terms of removing the current government in Salt Lake City. Perhaps we can work with allies other than natives to create a better future with more minority representation?"
lak.6.a:0 "We must work together with others to survive"
lak.6.b:0 "Lakotah has stand alone and will continue to stand alone"
lak.7.t:0 "The Billings Convention"
lak.7.d:0 "Currently, the Western Defence Command is the biggest threat to our threat and ambitions. We will need more allies or at least cooperating warlords to help take down the beast. The two likely candidates that will help us are the so called "Confederationists" in Pueblo and the mormons in St. George. They understand the feeling of being crushed by the WDC and they are very likely to accept our proposal to take down the federal menace once and for all. We will agree to form a coalition and divide the conquered territory equally."
lak.7.a:0 "Equally for now"
lak.8.t:0 "An invitation from Lakotah"
lak.8.d:0 "A group of diplomats from Lakotah have suggested that we form an coalition to destroy the Western Defence Commmand once and for all. The Lakotah promised us that in return for helping them, we shall gain control of all of Colorado. This is an offer we cannot refuse as this is our only chance of reuniting the United States under a great confederation."
lak.8.a:0 "Count us in"
lak.9.t:0 "An Invitation from Lakotah"
lak.9.d:0 "A group of diplomats from Lakotah have suggested that we form an coalition to destroy the Western Defence Commmand once and for all. The Lakotah promised us that in return for helping them, we shall gain control of the Wasatch Front. This is an offer we cannot refuse as this is our only chance of reuniting all mormons under one banner."
lak.9.a:0 "Count us in"
lak.10.t:0 "Deseret's Reply"
lak.10.d:0 "Heber Grant has accepted our offer for an alliance!"
lak.10.a:0 "Great!"
lak.11.t:0 "Pueblo's Reply"
lak.11.d:0 "Edwin Johnson has accepted our offer for an alliance!"
lak.11.a:0 "Good!"
lak.12.t:0 "Honoring the Deal"
lak.12.d:0 "Latkoah has called upon us to carry out the purpose of the Billings Pact. It is in our best interests to join this war and secure as much land as possible."
lak.12.a:0 "To arms!"
lak.13.t:0 "An Strange Request"
lak.13.d:0 "We have worked once with the Lakotah before to reclaim the rest of Utah, but they have presented a new idea. They suggest that we join their confederation of natives even though we are not native to the land. We have had skrimishes in the past with native americans which could have soured our relationship. Do we accept this offer?"
lak.13.a:0 "As long as we are treated as equals"
lak.13.b:0 "This can only mean disasters"
lak.14.t:0 "Deseret's Reply"
lak.14.d:0 "Deseret has agreed to our proposal and are willing to cooperate with us!"
lak.14.a:0 "Very good!"
lak.15.t:0 "Deseret's Reply"
lak.15.d:0 "Deseret has rejected our proposal and demanded that all our troops be drawn out of their occupied territory."
lak.15.a:0 "Time for war..."
lak.16.t:0 "Gone for Now"
lak.16.d:0 "With the help of our allies, we have driven out the federals from the lands south of us. We have now captured bordering territories and met with local tribes. With a much larger army and better experienced soldiers, we can create our own sphere of influence. For now, it would be justice to have these oppressors tried for their crimes aginst our people."
lak.16.a:0 "Sentenced to life in prison"
lak.17.t:0 "The End of Tyranny"
lak.17.d:0 "The Western Defence Command has been completely finished off and it is time to divide up the land. We must honor our deal as we are not untrustworthy people."
lak.17.a:0 "As promised"
