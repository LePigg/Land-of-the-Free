#EVENTS
stl.1.t:0 "A Freeman's City"
stl.1.d:0 "Saint Louis is a free city. Free of government, free of police, free of law. The only form of government that exists the mafia. They have a hands-off approach when governing the land. If the citizens of the city don't care about the frequent smuggling routine, why bother them? Saint Louis is most well-known for being the gateway between the rest of the United States and the international occupation zones. Of course, anything smuggled must pay a high middleman fee. With so much power in the hands of the mafia, Saint Louis has become very prosperous. Although, the Comission has no interest in expanding territory as they earn money from smuggling guns and alochol to fuel the warlord states."
stl.1.a:0 "It's just business"
stl.2.t:0 "Hunting Down Dewey"
stl.2.d:0 "Thomas E. Dewey, a lawyer from New York, was trying to prosecute Luciano for the past years. Now that the government has collapsed, there is no reason to not look for him. Earlier this month, a regular mafia patrol spotted a convoy coming from Baltimore with Dewey in it. Promptly, the black cars were shot at until the convoy crashed into the ditch beside the dirt road. Now that the only obstacle that once stood in the way is gone, it is time to get work done."
stl.2.a:0 "Money awaits"
stl.3.t:0 "The International Expeditionary Force Wages War!"
stl.3.d:0 "Word from our border guards up in Little Egypt have told us that the IEF are moving their troops down south to retake control of our territory. We must give it all our best to defend our rightful territory."
stl.3.a:0 "Testing our mettle eh?"
stl.4.t:0 "The International Expeditionary Force Retreats!"
stl.4.d:0 "Suprisingly, the IEF have retreated back to their original borders after an insurgent group known as the American Redemption Authority have taken control of southern Indiana. Although it is tempting to expanding our territory, we simply gain more money from concentrating all our power into Saint Louis. We will deal with the IEF some other time."
stl.4.a:0 "Cowards"
stl.5.t:0 "Standing Victorious"
stl.5.d:0 "Our forces stand victorious at defending our land and destroying our neighbor warlords. With this new acquired land, we shall give those lands to our most trusted leaders, Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky. Nobody can stop us from smuggling and importing goods from the mandates now."
stl.5.a:0 "Long Live the Commission!"
stl.6.t:0 "Silence in St. Louis"
stl.6.d:0 "The Comission that once ran St. Louis is now long gone. Another warlord has toppled their empire and the lucrative alcohol smuggling has finally stopped. Even then, many of our soldiers and civilians are drunkers that need to be rehabilitated. We can finally start undoing the damage Luciano has done in the past half decade."
stl.6.a:0 "Prohibition once again"
stl.7.t:0 "In Vain"
stl.7.d:0 "It seems like no matter what we do, our population refuses to accept our help with their crippling alcoholism. The best we can do is to just keep encouraging them to shake off their addiction."
stl.7.a:0 "More taxpayer money wasted..."
