 gps.1.d:0 "Betraying the Western Defense Command was not an easy decision to make. They had well intentions of maintaining the union though they did it the worse way possible. Orlando Ward along with other generals decided to cut contact with the WDC to protect the people of the Great Plains. A coalition of generals now keep the military in check and are more involved in citizenry life. The main philosophy is that the military isn't supposed to be a violent and intimidating force, but a kind and benevolent peace keeping force: smiliar to the police."
