eur.1.t:0 "In the Valley"
eur.1.d:0 "Shortly after the critical election of 1932 and subsequent assassination of president Roosevelt, Sinclair was elected governor of California. A member of the Common Man’s Party, he began his “End Poverty in California” project, seeking to deal with the effects of the Depression and improve the lives of the workers. However, within weeks of his governorship, catastrophe had emerged. Across the nation, unrest gripped the nation, blaming the CMP for the death of FDR and accusing them of wanting to follow in the steps of Lenin and plunge America into violent revolution. President Norman Thomas immediately requested War Plan White to be enacted to stop the riots and violence, but it appeared not even the army was on the CMP’s side. Taking advantage of the unrest, Douglas MacArthur staged a military coup in Washington D.C. and declared Martial Law to remove the socialists from power. However, the putsch was unable to secure the entire nation, and the socialist loyalists rebelled, causing a 2nd Civil War. Sinclair announced that California would stand alongside Thomas’ legitimate government and began to mobilize national guard units to defend California. To the north, Sinclair received a distress call from the CMP government of Seattle. The northern region of the West Coast had seceded from the Union and declared the Provisional Cascadian State to fight the socialists, and were in the process of sieging Seattle. Determined to save his comrades, Sinclair established the Socialist West Coast Revolutionary Army, or SWCRA, and began an invasion into Cascadia. However, the invasion was stalled when Federalist troops from the Western Defence Command began an invasion into the Mojave Desert, forcing them to relocate troops to defend the front. However, due to a miscommunication, the invasion of Cascadia commenced, and the under supplied and manned force was crushed by the Cascadian army. The resulting counterattack by Cascadia led to Northern California being occupied, and the WDC’s forces had overrun the Mojave and were rapidly approaching Yosemite. Taking advantage of California’s precarious situation, former governor Hiram Johnson declared loyalty to the Federals, and began to plan a coup to remove Sinclair from power. In the south, Los Angeles lost faith in the government, and soon rebelled in the Technocrat Revolt, led by Howard Scott. Soon after, Johnson rallied anti socialist loyalists and marched on Sacramento, ousting Sinclair from power. However, in the resulting firefight from the coup, general Maurice Rose orchestrated an evacuation to Fresno and relocated Sinclair’s government there. With the putsch, all authority in California collapsed. The CMP now sits in the Valley, with the effects of the Depression still in full swing as well as the scars of war, which has led to the End Poverty in California movement being considered a complete failure. However, Sinclair will not let the flames of Democracy and Solidarity fade out, and has promised that the hardships of the working class will be dealt with and the reclamation the West Coast will soon arrive."
eur.1.a:0 "Out of the Jungle, into the fire."
eur.2.t:0 "The Trial of Doolittle"
eur.2.d:0 "Despite their strategic position in the mountains, the Federal forces were unable to defeat our armies, and soon their leader Jimmy Doolittle was captured by our forces. A now controversial trial is before us. Doolittle had led the Western Defence Command’s expedition into California during the Civil War, and his forces dealt heavy losses to our Red Guards. He now stands before us to be judged, but the choice will be difficult. The hardliner wings of the CMP want him executed for treason, having fought us during the civil war and causing the collapse of the Californian Socialist forces. However, more liberal wings of the party and establishment parties feel an execution is too much, and would rather have him incarcerated. They argue he was only doing what he thought was right for America, and not killing him would improve us in the eyes of our non socialist population. Plus, if we kill him, are we any better than the stratocratic regime of the Federals? What should we do?"
eur.2.a:0 "Death is what all traitors deserve!"
eur.2.b:0 "Lock him up, we are better than the Federalists."
eur.3.t:0 "Freeing the Coast"
eur.3.d:0 "Upon our invasion of Monterey, we had received intel that we had allies even within the city. The rule of Rossi was one of kleptocracy and oppression, forcing the working man to work tirelessly in order to increase Rossi’s own wealth. When our invasion began, a massive strike broke out in the streets of the city. Rossi sent militia to disperse the crowd, but they refused to fire upon them, siding with the workers. By the time we had reached the capitol, we found a crowd of cheering citizens, welcoming us as liberators. They had stormed the capitol and captured Rossi, and he can now stand trial for his oppression of the working class."
eur.3.a:0 "The chains are broken once more."
eur.4.t:0 "In the Name of the Revolution"
eur.4.d:0 "With the threat of a military coup gone, we can finally move in to secure our holdings within the state. With loyal NDC agents at his side, comrade Gus Hall has told his secret higher ups to begin to move to prevent the reactionaries and traitors from stopping our revolution. Immediately, many were arrested and set off to the work camps, where they would earn their freedom in labor. However, the wretched traitor Benjamin Gitlow knew too much even before our election. He has always based his platform off stopping the true revolution, letting the capitalist swine bring our great state to ruin. He was last seen summoning his traitorous goons alongside him, telling them to “save revolutionary democracy” before running over the border to Mexico. Luckily, one of our NDC agents had caught wind that he was seeking asylum in La Paz. After he had unloaded his car, he went inside a bar to plan his speech to traitors in the future. During this, one of our loyal agents placed a contraption inside his car’s engine. When he attempted to start the car, it exploded, and Gitlow was killed instantly. It was only the first of many, and soon more traitors shall share his fate."
eur.4.a:0 "Only we can save the Revolution!"
eur.5.t:0 "The First Election"
eur.5.d:0 "Even through the horrors of civil war, Sinclair has remained true to his belief in democracy, and the elections are upon us. There has been intense campaigning in each party, as this is the first election since the collapse. The incumbent, Upton Sinclair, is still very popular among the masses, with his moderate wing of the CMP appealing to both revolutionaries and the establishment. He seeks to continue the EPIC project while restoring order to California. The main opposition is the CMP-E, led by Benjamin Gitlow. He considers Sinclair’s policies as being too lenient on capitalism, and urges more extreme measures must be taken to protect the worker. Gitlow was once a member of the radical wing of the CMP, but he grew disgusted from what he had witnessed them do during the war, leaving the radical wing. He still stands for the preservation of labor and empowered unions, but has based his platform off containing the communist menace, calling them “an insult to Marx’s teachings.” Many members feel as though some of his policies are actually conservative in nature, but this helps him appeal to the moderates. Finally, one new party has risen due to the rise of socialist empowerment within the state. The CMP-H is a Marxist-Leninist party led by Gus Hall. He recognizes the Soviet Union as the true leader of the revolution and seeks to completely dismantle the capitalist system, paving the way for radical revolution. His critics, such as Gitlow, have labeled him a despotic authoritarian who uses terror to reign, saying he is no better than the “stooges in Italy”. However, Gus Hall has labeled them as federal sympathizers, and urges that any means necessary must be done in order to free America from capitalism. Either way, this election will be a close one, and the winner of the presidency is…"

Next up, following the end of the ban of non-CMP parties, the Democratic and Republican parties have returned to the ballots. The Democrats, led by Sheridan Downey, were initially the ones that were within the CMP-Democrat coalition of the 1932 election, and supported the ideas of welfare and economic relief from former president Franklin Delano Roosevelt. However, in the midst of the civil war, many of them became disillusioned with radical socialism, and had retreated from the CMP. Downey was initially the Lieutenant Governor of Sinclair’s California, but the failure of the campaign against the Federals caused him to leave the party. He is committed to still helping the worker as well as finishing the works of FDR, but he is taking a much more moderate approach than the CMP in order to not alienate a populace used to capitalism. He has shown signs of being willing to negotiate with the CMP, and perhaps the coalition may reform. On the other side, the Republican party is also back on the stage. Led by Frank Merriam, they have always been dissenters to the CMP’s time in office, and the loss in the civil war only strengthened their cause. Merriam has sworn to bring an end to socialism, and rebuild the old system which he felt was bringing America to a golden age. Many of the CMP’s voters have campaigned against him, painting him as a greedy kleptocrat that will only exploit the workers, but the more conservative areas of the populace have gladly chosen to back him, feeling he is their only chance to stop the “Red Menace”.

eur.9.t:0 "Unrest Within the Ranks"
eur.9.d:0 "With the newfound power of the Communists within the state, a bill has been presented to congress that will effectively end democracy in California. This bill will ensure that the communist party will always win the elections by being the only party on the ballot. However, the military has been keeping a close eye on our regime. Although they have always been loyal to socialism, they are still distrustful to communism, and furthermore they are firm in their trust of democracy. Ever since the bill has been proposed, the military has plotted in the shadows to form a last ditch attempt to preserve democracy in California. Such traitors cannot be allowed within our ranks, but trying to enforce loyalty in our command may create a rip in our army, leaving it in a damaged state. What should be done?"
eur.9.a:0 "A few dead traitors never hurt anyone."
eur.9.b:0 "We won't scrap our plans over a bunch of rabble-rousers!"
eur.10.t:0 "Rose Launches Coup"
eur.10.d:0 "The day before president Gus Hall could effectively make himself president for life, military units mobilized across the country, rallying support from dissidents against our regime. CMP-H members were removed from their posts and arrested by military officials. In one final show, chief of staff Maurice Rose organized a March on Sacramento, and alongside infantry battalions they stormed the capitol building. Gus Hall was captured, being accused of treason against the United States, and is sentenced to life imprisonment. Maurice Rose is now effectively the leader of the country, but he has reassured that the junta is only temporary, and is making plans to restore democracy to California."
eur.10.a:0 "We must preserve the constitution!"

eur.11.d:0 "After a series of arrests against CMP-H members the military government has announced that the communist threat has receded. Although they still exist, their party is in fragments as well as being outlawed in the nation. Maurice Rose, remembering the horrors caused by MacArthur’s coup years before, has already announced that he will relinquish his power to a civilian government. With the ban of the communists, the military has also announced that both the Republican and Democratic parties will be allowed to partake in the elections, with the fall of the Communist regime bolstering their popularity.

eur.12.a:0 "Excellent."
eur.13.t:0 "True Solidarity"
eur.13.d:0 "Racism has been the very bane of American society ever since Columbus landed in the New World for the first time. Hall has realized it as an abomination, separating comrades in arms solely on the color of this skin. It is now a crime to discriminate against anyone solely based on their skin color. NDC and police have already begun to dismantle racist organizations like the Dixiecrats and KKK, assuring that all men are equal in our society. Together we shall end White California, by any means necessary."
eur.13.a:0 "Solidarity Forever, together!"
eur.14.t:0 "Ending White America"
eur.14.d:0 "Ever since the beginning racism has torn the United States apart, causing the first Civil War and setting the stones for the second. Even with the triumph over slavery, the so called Jim Crow Laws have forced the races of the world to live in separation. This can stand for no longer. Our administration has announced the Civil Rights Act, ending segregation so that all men may truly be equal. However, the conservatives of the nation have furiously campaigned against this act, but their efforts were for nothing. Now, all men will hold hands side by side."
eur.14.a:0 "As the Constitution intended."
eur.15.t:0 "The Lost Soldiers"
eur.15.d:0 "After having marched through the mountains and deserts of California, we have reclaimed the state from those who had once stood against us. However, with the establishment parties having emerged victorious in the elections, the revolution has not fully descended upon the West. Many stood against the Fresno government during its short existence, having caused the collapse of California and then opposing the reunification of the state. Many of our brothers in arms had fallen to them, but we must remember that our enemies were Americans too. With the moderate parties in power, they have sought a campaign of pardoning the military staff that had sworn loyalty to other governments during the Reunification War. They believe this is the best way to appeal to the moderate populace to reduce the fear caused by the Red takeover of the state. The Federals in Sierra will be exempt, however, as they have openly destroyed democracy and have all already been charged as war criminals. Our first choice could be Johnson’s men. They had previously shown loyalty to California during the Federal invasion, but joined Hiram Johnson in his coup against Sinclair. They may be willing to work with us once again. On the other hand, we have the command of Los Angeles. Although the technocratic regime was a direct assault against democracy, the men of the City of Angels have confessed that they had only rallied under Scott because they needed a strong leader to hold the nation together, but are fully willing to offer their services to the defence of democracy. However, many of the Socialist cliques within the nation are against these pardons, as they still show resentment towards the officer cliques because of the death they had inflicted upon their comrades. To appease them, we could simply dishonorably discharge all of the “traitors”, but we could potentially alienate our voter base. Alternatively we could choose to pardon all of them, but this would enrage the CMP voter base, destabilizing the nation."
eur.15.a:0 "We cannot allow traitors into our ranks."
eur.15.b:0 "Pardon the men of Sacramento, we cannot abandon our allies."

eur.16.t:0 "Compromise with Moscow"
eur.16.d:0 "The Soviets have always been our main benefactors, supplying men, equipment, and supplies to us during the Federal invasion of California. However, ever since Sinclair announced that the capitalist parties are no longer banned from the elections, the Soviets have grown distant from us. They have accused us of allowing the upper class to torment the workers, and have cut off any support they had been sending us. Without the Soviets, our government may find it incredibly difficult to stay standing, so we have sent ambassadors to Moscow to discuss any means of maintaining relations between our two states. We have told the Soviets that we will do whatever is necessary to defend the worker, but they aren’t fully convinced. The Soviets have sent us a demand to greatly leash any capitalist policies we may have. The market is to be heavily monitored and major industries are to be state controlled. This is a direct assault on American capitalism, but not agreeing will mean ruining relations with our former ally. What should be done?"
eur.16.a:0 "We have already sacrificed too much!"

With their failure to secure the votes in the previous election, the CMP Hardliners have lost their voter base, with many deradicalizing and joining the opposition. As a result, the communists were unable to reach the ballot vote minimum, and their party has mostly faded into irrelevancy.

eur.20.t:0 "Our Policy on the Strikers"
eur.20.d:0 "While we believed that the strike would disperse on its own, it appears to only have grown in the time that it has spread. We could end up having a large-scale revolution on our hands if we do nothing. The government has convened for an emergency session on dealing with the strike. The first option, presented with those who still have some socialist sympathies, have suggested we cave in to the striker’s demands for better wages and a more lenient policy on socialism, but this would end up standing against everything we campaigned for. The second option was presented by officers formerly within the corps of the other warlords; we send in the national guard to disperse the strikers by force. This could greatly end up aggravating the situation even more, but it will guarantee the end of the strike."

Even though our government has lost face, nothing got too out of hand."
eur.21.a:0 "It's the best we can do."
eur.22.t:0 "Blood on the Bay"
eur.22.d:0 "With the strike continuing to grow, the national guard was dispatched to the bay area. Mostly consisting of former Sacramento units, their disdain for socialism would ensure their ability to stop the strike. The guard ordered the strikers to get back to work, and threatened to use force if they did not comply. This ultimatum was denied, and soon the guard launched tear gas into the crowd. The following chaos erupted into a clash between the strikers and the national guard, with several ending up wounded and two of the strikers were killed. Although the strike is over, this is not the end of the violence, as many of the county governors have denounced our government as illegitimate."

Allying former moderates of the CMP, they attempted a coup in the capital. Thankfully, their attempt was thwarted, as he could not secure the support of the military, and Hall fled the nation to seek asylum in the Soviet Union. But this is not the end. The failed coup has only worsened the situation, with even some of the moderates beginning to lose faith in our government. State wide martial law has been declared, and military units are already in the process of clamping down on the populace."
eur.23.a:0 "Order must be restored!"
eur.24.t:0 "The San Francisco Bay Strike"
eur.24.d:0 "Perhaps we have been too hasty with our attempts at weeding out socialism that a large-scale strike has broken out in the port of San Francisco. Many of the supporters of the CMP have denounced our government as “tyrannical”, and are refusing to comply with the restoration of big business rights and the capitalist system. We have tried to pin all the blame on the communists to justify a crackdown, but it has only worsened the situation."
