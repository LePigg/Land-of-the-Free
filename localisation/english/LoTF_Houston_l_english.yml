In the north, Father Coughlin has won the hearts of many texans yet lacks the necessary materiel to overwhelming win the conflict. To our direct south, Tejas along with the various CMP rebels pose a large threat to state security due to their professional military. In the end, [SRT.GetLeader] chooses to..."

Recently, however, we have received official-looking documents from a government in Houston, aiming to restore true democracy to the Lone Star State. Facing radicals and extremists on all sides, if they hope to survive they will likely need our help, but we are barely scraping by as is. What should we do?"
