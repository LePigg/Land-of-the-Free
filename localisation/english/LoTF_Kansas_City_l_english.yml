#EVENTS
kan.1.t:0 "The Political Machine"
kan.1.d:0 "Pendergast always takes an opportunity given to him. As the local governments started collapsing, he took it upon himself to take over the local area. With prominent ties to elected officials, he effectively controls the whole area. Corruption runs rampid around these parts of America and there is much to be done before Pendergast solidifies his rule."
kan.1.a:0 "The man behind the curtain"
kan.2.t:0 "Overhauling the Police"
kan.2.d:0 "The police have always turned a blind eye to Pendergast's activites. Now that all resistance against the political machine is erased, Pendergast has full controll over the police force. In the end, he decides that..."
kan.2.a:0 "no reform is needed"
kan.2.b:0 "the police must be integrated into the mafia"
kan.3.t:0 "A Talk with Truman"
kan.3.d:0 "Pendergast was first introduced to Truman by his nephew. Through the collapse, Truman was able to fight his way to a senator seat for Missouri. Secretly, he has been trying to return American to democracy behind the back of Pendergast. The two men will be unknowingly at odds with each other for the next couple years."
kan.3.a:0 "Let the game begin"
kan.4.t:0 "A Deal with the Smugglers"
kan.4.d:0 "The deal is short and simple. We will not interfere with their trading business. In exchange, they will provide with a convoy of guns. We both mutually agree for a non-aggression pact."
kan.4.a:0 "Let's see if they agree to this"
kan.5.t:0 "An Offer from the Political Machine"
kan.5.d:0 "The deal is quite short and simple. They pledge to not interfere in our smuggling business. In addition, they request a shipment of arms and a non-aggression will be signed. Should we accept?"
kan.5.a:0 "Anything for money and control"
kan.5.b:0 "We don't need their help"
kan.6.t:0 "The Reply"
kan.6.d:0 "Charles Luciano accepts our deal!"
kan.6.a:0 "Great news"
kan.7.t:0 "The Reply"
kan.7.d:0 "Charles Luciano declines our deal."
kan.7.a:0 "Oh well"
kan.8.t:0 "An Ultimatum"
kan.8.d:0 "Sequoyah is really no threat towards us. They simply want to have order in their life and to be protected against the fascists and socialists. Let's send them the simple ultimatum. They are welcome to join us or face war."
kan.8.a:0 "Perhaps less blood will be shed?"
kan.9.t:0 "An Ultimatum"
kan.9.d:0 "The Political Machine from Kansas City has sent us an ultimatum. Be annexed or face war. What should we do?"
kan.9.a:0 "Accept annexation"
kan.9.b:0 "Rejected annexation"
kan.10.t:0 "The Reply"
kan.10.d:0 "Sequoyah will voluntarily join our country!"
kan.10.a:0 "Good"
kan.11.t:0 "The Reply"
kan.11.d:0 "Sequoyah refuses to join our country!"
kan.11.a:0 "Shame"
kan.12.t:0 "An Ultimatum"
kan.12.d:0 "The Mississippi Settlements is really no threat towards us. They simply want to have order in their life and to be protected against the fascists and socialists. Let's send them the simple ultimatum. They are welcome to join us or face war."
kan.12.a:0 "Perhaps less blood will be shed?"
kan.13.t:0 "An Ultimatum"
kan.13.d:0 "The Political Machine from Kansas City has sent us an ultimatum. Be annexed or face war. What should we do?"
kan.13.a:0 "Accept annexation"
kan.13.b:0 "Rejected annexation"
kan.14.t:0 "The Reply"
kan.14.d:0 "The Mississippi Settlements will voluntarily join our country!"
kan.14.a:0 "Good"
kan.15.t:0 "The Reply"
kan.15.d:0 "The Mississippi Settlements refuses to join our country!"
kan.15.a:0 "Shame"
kan.16.t:0 "New Equipment"
kan.16.d:0 "Field Marshal Craig walked up and down the new recruits and their equipment. It has been a while since he has seen soldiers wearing clean and professional grade uniforms. Behind them were tanks and infantry vehicles cleaned and repaired from the captured equipment of the Great Plains Society. For the first time since the Collapse, Criag will be commanding professional and powerful tank brigades instead of local militas filled with disgruntled young men. There is a new feeling in the air. A step closer to the old federal army."
kan.16.a:0 "Use them wisely"
kan.17.t:0 "The Gateway to the West"
kan.17.d:0 "It has been a few days since Luciano and his mafia group "The Comission" have fled St. Louis to god knows where. It doesn't matter know as we have full control of all the information that comes in and out of the interior America and the rest of the world. The importation of alcohol will be allowed to continue but only for the civillians. The reason is simple, the soldiers won't be drunk all the time and the state will earn plenty of tax from the alcohol flow. Call it a ghetto tax. Once the surrounding lands have been cleared of all mafia resistance, we annouced a new free regime under the guidance of Pendergast for a transition into democracy. We really have no intention of allowing free elections; why give up power?"
kan.17.a:0 "I wouldn't say "freed," more like "under new management.""
kan.18.t:0 "The Trial of William Pelley"
kan.18.d:0 "The people watched as the man once feared and brutally ruled Texlahoma stand with a bag over his head in front of the execution crowd. Truman raised his glasses and the paper that had the verdict. "In the case of Pelley v State of Missouri, the defendant has been found guilty of all accounts of war crimes, crimes against humanity, treason, and sedition. The punishment for these crimes will be in the highest degree: the death penalty. The crowd cheered and clapped in excitement, but really only to appease the guards watching over them. In the middle of commotion, the executioner pulled the lever and Pelley dropped dead."
kan.18.a:0 "At least some justice prevails"
kan.19.t:0 "Convergence"
kan.19.d:0 "Truman nervously walked over to Pendergast in his backyard mansion pool. Guards and major generals alike were having drinks while holding guns to protect Pendergast during his daily relaxation session. He knwe that it was now or never to free the people of the South Mississippi Republic from the political machine. Before the pool party, Truman spoke to many of the war hero generals and individually spoke to some of Pendergast's most personal guards about his plan to oust the despot. "What do you want now Truman?" growled Pendergast setting his drink down as Truman blocked the sunlight. After a few seconds of tension building staring, Truman raised his left hand, signaling the silent cue. Immediately, the majority of the surrounding guards cocked and aimed their weapons at Pendergast and his allies. "Tom Pendergast, you have been accused of treason and violating the constitution on multiple occasions; anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law," Truman recited word to word from those days back of being a judge. Pendergast, shocked and in disbelief, looked around the pool. Nobody he trusted was objecting to this madness. Nobody was fighting on his behalf. The guards standing next to him grabbed him by the arms and began carrying him away. Screaming and kicking as he flailed his arms around, hoping to break free somehow. All of a sudden, Pendergast's heart could not take it anymore and he suffered a heart attack right in front of Truman. Truman watched as the eyes of a man that once terrorized and exploited the people he ruled slowly role into the back of his head."
kan.19.a:0 "It's finally over"
kan.20.t:0 "Convergence"
kan.20.d:0 "Truman nervously walked over to Pendergast in his backyard mansion pool.

"What do you want now Truman?" growled Pendergast setting his drink down as Truman blocked the sunlight. After a few seconds of tension building staring, Truman raised his left hand, signaling the silent cue. Immediately, a small amount of the surrounding guards cocked and aimed their weapons at Pendergast and his allies. "Tom Pendergast, you have been accused of treason and violating the constitution on multiple occasions; anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law," Truman recited word to word from those days back of being a judge. Pendergast, shocked and in disbelief, looked around the pool. Before he even processed what Truman had said, his supporters and guards raised their guns and began shooting at the traitors. In the shootout, Malin Craig shoved Pendergast onto the floor behind a brush to protect him from the hail of bullets. After what seemed to have been hours, the gun fire stopped and Pendergast looked around and saw the bodies of his personal guards. He would never know which guards were on his side or Truman's nor would he really care. He could see Truman's body by the corner of the pool face down, presumably trying to flee the chaos."
kan.20.a:0 "No monkey wrench will stop this machine!"
kan.21.t:0 "Warring States"
kan.21.d:0 "Our military advisors and leader have unanimously agreed that now is the best time to expand into our neighbors' lands in order to secure our position much better. The war machine has been turned on once again for the better of our country."
kan.21.a:0 "One step closer to unification"
