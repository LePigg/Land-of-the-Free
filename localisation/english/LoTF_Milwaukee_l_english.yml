 mil.1.t:0 "The Third Path"
 mil.1.d:0 "With the beginning of the American Civil War, Mark Clark decided that he would remain loyal to the constitution and join the Red Guards of the CMP. Mark himself was distrustful of socialism, but the idea of an apolitical military resided within him and his men and decided that MacArthur was the true threat to American principals. When Federal insurgent cells opened in the Midwest, Mark Clark was ordered to launch an expedition to destroy the partisan cells. During the brief Iowa campaign, mass repression against the civilian populace suspected of having Federal sympathies ordered by the Vanguardist wing of the CMP caused Clark to become disillusioned with the socialist cause. Eventually, failures in the Eastern Front caused the state of Minnesota to enter an open revolt and Clark’s army was ordered to crush the rebellion. The campaign was a total failure; the national guard of Minnesota mobilized and delivered a series of crushing defeats against Clark’s army and managed to encircle a portion of his force in Duluth. With defeat all but certain, Clark retreated into the forests of Wisconsin. Clark’s sanity had failed during these violent times, the remnants of whatever loyal forces he had left declared a regency for a new American king. The republic and socialism had failed to bring prosperity; a stronger hand was needed. Clark declared himself general regent and launched a coup against the Wisconsin governor. His forces overpowered the demoralized national guard and forced governor Phillip La Follette into exile in Minnesota. Now, the newly proclaimed Regency of Milwaukee controls the northern state, ready to fight for king and country in search of the long lost descendant of George Washington, the only true king of America."

 mil.2.d:0 "The only somewhat friendly people that we border are the Canadians due to Regent Clark's previous visits to the Dominion. Perhaps the Regent could talk to the Canadian government so they could send some supplies to us."
 mil.2.a:0 "We must hope for the best"
 mil.3.t:0 "Canada Agrees"
 mil.3.d:0 "The Canadians, initially hesitant, have given us a few stockpiles of their old weapons and artillery. Although the equipment is not the latest, we must be extremely thankful that they gave us any at all."
 mil.3.a:0 "Thank god"
 mil.4.t:0 "Canada Refuses"
 mil.4.d:0 "We should have known better. Canada would never intervene for any American Warlord unless the British would allow them too. They refused to give us any equipment and forced Regent Clark to return back to Milwaukee."
 mil.4.a:0 "That was to be expected"

 mil.7.t:0 "The Superior Question"
 mil.7.d:0 "It is time to come to a decision about the Superior question. With pressure from the governments of Michigan and Erie in an attempt to force us to relinquish control of Superior to Michigan, many of the citizens and the regent himself are starting to question whether or not it is worth it to keep superior. Relinquishing the control of Superior to Michigan would stop the pressure resulting from keeping superior, but Superior is part of our country and is a decent portion of our economy. Would it be worth keeping Superior?"
 mil.7.a:0 "Superior is rightfully the regents lands!"
 mil.7.b:0 "It is theirs after all"
 mil.8.t:0 "The People v. Norman Thomas"
 mil.8.d:0 "The cyanide pill failed to do the job and now President Thomas was blinded and bound up in the back of what is most likely a truck. “Get up!” someone yelled clo se enough to Thomas that he could feel the spit droplets land on his check. The blindfold was ripped off him and the blinding light bulbs pierced his eyes. In front of him were soldiers with the Milwaukee insignia and Mark Clark standing with him in some large neglected basement. “In the case of the People of America versus Norman Thomas, the court hereby finds you guilty of treason and sedition against the Washington Monarchy. The punishment of such acts will be the death penalty,” Clark recited from memorization. Thomas scoffed at this sorry excuse of a fair trial. Where was the jury? Where was the judge? This isn’t even a courthouse! He couldn’t tell what was more humiliating: dying to a traitorous general or allowing the American socialist revolution to die over his watch. As bullets shredded his body, his last thoughts prayed that someone else will carry on the revolution."
 mil.8.a:0 "The Socialist Tyrant is Dead!"
 mil.9.t:0 "The Tale of Two Friends"
 mil.9.d:0 "Regent Clark seemed to have been happy for once this year. The Federalists have finally been destroyed and his good old friend Eisenhower will be meeting Clark. Perhaps he can pardon and talk some sense into Eisenhower to join the royal military ranks. Just then, Eisenhower, in his tattered uniform, walked into Clark’s office along with a few guards. Clark held out his hand; “Hello Ike. It’s nice to see you. I know this may seem sudden and all, but I would like to see you join our ranks. I will personally pardon you for joining MacArthur, and I’ll give you-.” “Listen Wayne. As much as I like you, I can not betray my principles and backstab the Federalists. I am going to Iowa to pick up where MacArthur left off,” Eisenhower bluntly told Clark with an emotionless face. Clark had to face it that Eisenhower was not going to join him. “If that is your wish, so be it. I’ll make sure you safely make it across the Mississippi River, but you mustn't return back to the royal lands or you will face death.”"
 mil.9.a:0 "..."
 mil.10.t:0 "Redemption for the Few"
 mil.10.d:0 "The people of Michigan have risen up against the Federalist menace alongside our own military. Now that the military junta that once ruled over Grand Rapids is gone, we must decide what to do about the generals that worked alongside George Grunert. Regent Clark has the final say on whether we should pardon those generals. This may come at the cost of our approval among the Michiganders. In the end, Clark decides to…"
 mil.10.a:0 "Execute them for being traitors"
 mil.10.b:0 "Allow them to join the ranks"
 mil.11.t:0 "One to the Next"
 mil.11.d:0 "Walter Bedell Smith had been captured upon the fall of his small collaborator regime. He and the rest of his men had been taken up to Milwaukee to stand trial. Clark himself was to oversee this trial. The defendants tried to justify their reasons for collaboration, but instilled almost no response from the court. Before they could be judged as guilty, Clark stepped in. “I know Smith. He is a trustworthy man. Willing to make the hard choices if it meant for the better of those around him. He has shown that he is willing to stand his ground for the crown of England.” There was a murmur in the court. “Who’s to say that he cannot give his loyalty to the crown of Columbia? Now, to the men of Indiana and Illinois, I grant thee a royal pardon, and enlistment into the royal armed forces.” Lewis Brereton glanced at Walter. “Really? We’re gonna work for a bunch of mad men who think this is the medieval ages?”. Walter looked back. “Better than being dead.”"
 mil.11.a:0 "Welcome to the front."
 mil.12.t:0 "Caged Eagle"
 mil.12.d:0 "The security guards dragged Lindbergh into the oval office. Following the fall of Indianapolis Lindbergh attempted to escape the state but the Royal Army quickly caught him. Mark Clark had interests in meeting Lindbergh himself, and this was the perfect chance. The two guards tossed him into a chair in front of Clark, and stepped back with their rifles. “So, what is this? A mocking session?” Lindbergh exclaimed. “Why would that be?”Clark responded. “I’m not here to listen to the delusional ramblings of a psychotic monster like you, Clark. A king will never be fit to rule America, you’re all a bunch of British lap dogs!”. Clark sighed, placing his hand on his face. “So, I’m the madman, huh? Look at how far you’ve fallen. A once great aviator and hero to the American people, and now here you are like a scared dog blaming your problems on people who have done nothing” Clark said. “Listen here you psycho, you seek to tear down the American dream! You will end the grand republic! A king for America! You’re insane!” Lindbergh fired back. “And yet, you turned to violent rhetoric, killing those that don’t agree with you and forcing everyone to swear absolute loyalty to your state. Now. Try to tell me again how you are the one ready to save the nation”. Lindbergh sat silent, looking around the room frantically. He suddenly lunged at Clark, but was subdued by Clark quickly striking him in the face. The guards once again dragged Lindbergh away, to the gallows."
 mil.12.a:0 "See you in hell."
 mil.13.t:0 "The True Crown"
 mil.13.d:0 "The British puppet state in lower Indiana has fallen. The local populace followed us as we advanced against the international forces. With the population in open revolt, the British collaborator regime stood no chance. Upon victory in Indiana, Clark gave a speech to a large crowd following a royal parade. “The kings of Britain have once again tried to have a foreign monarch rule the country, but the will and drive of the American people will always defeat foreign imperialism. We will fulfill the dream of Washington, and create a nation stronger than ever before!”."
 mil.13.a:0 "Hail Columbia!"
