ARA.2.title:0 "Walter's Demise"
ARA.2.desc:0 "Walter Bedell Smith, better known as “Ol’ Backstabber” for his collaboration, knew his fate the moment his regime fell. He had known that the ARA had been planning his violent end ever since he became Governor General of Indianapolis. With the fall of his final defenses, he was apprehended by Legionary guards and thrown into a jail cell. A verdict was given with no trial: execution by firing squad. He was dragged to his death room. completely silent the whole time. He was tied down to a chair, and watched as his executioners loaded their rifles. Suddenly, as they finished preparing, he noticed that Lindbergh himself was one of the riflemen, for which he decided that he could be silent no longer. “You are all insane!”, he yelled. “I joined you initially because you promised a strong America, but you have twisted your promise into a horrific excuse for oppression!”, he continued. “I realized that someone needed to stop you, and the only ones who could were the god damn League of Nations!”. “I had no choice. You sons of bitches would do nothing but lead to America’s de-“ before he could finish, he was interrupted by the sound of rifles and a following thud."
ARA.2.a:0 "Justice has been served."
ARA.1.title:0 "The American Redemption Authority"
ARA.1.desc:0 "With the onset of the Second Civil War, the Federalists established the Southern Defense Command under George S. Patton to pacify the Socialist rebels in the South. With this new call to arms, Charles Lindbergh soon appealed to Patton to establish an air brigade to win the war in the skies. As an American hero, Patton accepted Lindbergh’s plea, and soon an air brigade with Lindbergh as the captain was established. He flew scouting missions for the Federalists as well as engaging in bombing runs against the Socialists, leveling their entrenched positions and fortresses. Things were going smoothly, until the East Coast Intervention. Lindbergh was enraged that the League of Nations would intervene in American affairs, and refused to cooperate with them. After the Federalists declared war on the League, Lindbergh was ordered on an air support mission in Pennsylvania to help a Federal assault to retake Philadelphia. Near the start of the battle, a French Flak Gun hit Lindbergh’s wing, sending the plane plummeting into the ground below. He managed to steer the plane to prevent his death, but the crash knocked him unconscious. When he awoke hours later, he saw the corpses of his fellow Americans and the League’s annihilation of the city. From this point forward, he swore revenge against all who had wronged America. He formed the Patriotic Legion of America, a disgruntled veterans association for the Federalists, showing no mercy to anyone who got in their way. He managed to establish a provisional junta in Indiana, but after Walter’s betrayal, League forces toppled his regime, forcing him into exile. During his exile, he met Gerald L. K. Smith, a man who loathed the traitors as much as Lindbergh did. Although he held anti semitic and racist views, Lindbergh deemed him a “true patriot”, and named him the true president of America. Smith now is the figurehead for the Legion’s civilian wing, and as their plan springs into motion, Lindbergh has one goal: to cleanse America of all traitors and to reclaim the east coast by any means."

ARA.4.title:0 "The Oath of Washington"
ARA.4.desc:0 "I am a patriotic American citizen. I am a patriotic American worker. I am a patriotic American soldier. For in all I do, I do with patriotism, as is the way of the Patriotic Legion. My loyalty is to America and only America. I will do all in my power to make America strong. Through our might, American will be reborn stronger than before. All traitors to the nation will be crushed. There cannot be weakness in a Great America. For the day that the Redemption comes, we will all be ready to guide America to its glorious destiny."
ARA.4.a:0 "One nation, under God..."
ARA.5.title:0 "Like the Founding Fathers"
ARA.5.desc:0 "Clark was beaten and bruised, dragged on his legs by two Legionaries. The crowd around him jeered and mocked him, throwing objects at him as he was dragged into his execution room. As he was pulled in, he saw a guillotine in front of him. Gerald K. Smith was looking right at him, with a grin on his face. “So, you think you’re a king, huh?” he jeered. “How about we treat you like one?”. Mark was shoved into the guillotine, with the executioner getting ready to release it. “And here we are. Once again, we have proven that no king will ever rule America. The British tried years ago, and they tried again and again, but we will make sure they fail. Now you, Mark, will be their example.” The room erupted into cheers, with Mark glancing around desperately. “Our blood for our Nation!” was the last thing Mark heard before he heard the cleaver falling down, and then it all stopped."
ARA.5.a:0 "The Republic lives on."
ARA.6.t:0 "A Pure State"
ARA.6.d:0 "Norman Thomas had been residing in the basement of the Chicago capital building. He knew this was the end. After all he had tried, his journey was over, the reactionary hordes slaughtered his comrades on their rampage to tear out the beating heart of the Revolution. Norman could only wait for fate to claim him, but Browder pursued his own terms. In a last radio call to whichever Red forces that continued to resist the fascist advance. “Comrades, we have pushed for true liberation, our desire is not to paint the ground red, but the souls of all chanting in the worker’s solidarity. To all that continue to resist to the end, you have kept the flame started by Marx and Lenin alive. Long live the new America! Long live the proletariat! Long live the Revolution!”, and with that, a bang was heard over the radio before cutting out. Thomas watched over the lifeless body of Browder, remembering how Cox had lost his life trying to improve morale on the front only to be killed by a bombing raid by the Legion. Thomas could hear boots coming down the stairs, with any remaining loyalists being cut down by the incoming enemy forces. A blast tore the basement door off, and the Legionaries rushed into the room. Thomas did not be remembered as a politician who ran and hid for causes they did not truly believe in, and was committed to stand by the American people to his final breath. But the glares of pure hatred from once his fellow Americans sent a deep cut of despair into his psyche. Could America truly be saved? Now was not the time to ask this question, but only to follow fate. “Do what you must, I do not feel anything.” He uttered to the riflemen. Almost immediately after, the legionaries opened fire upon him, unloading almost all the ammo they had on them. His disfigured remains were taken up and burned in a trash pile, with his ashes scattered into the air. The sounds of gunfire continued to ring throughout the city, long after the war was over."

ARA.11.d:0 "With the final march forward, the armies of the midwest were no match for our patriots. With the northern region of the nation secured, we believed that all was well. But this was clearly not the case. The jingoistic fervor of our population has began to die down now that the wars have stopped, and the soldiers are transforming into the traitors they spent years fighting by demanding better conditions in our army. The economy is in ruins, and the economic war machine has faltered as war no longer stimulates it. The traitorous populations of the north have already begun to openly rebel against us, even gaining sympathy among the army. To make things worse, the party and military cannot agree on what should be done to fix this mess, and a power struggle has torn a rift in our government. The military advocates for using brute force to crush the dissidents and stepping up our militarization of the nation to prepare for the Redemption. On the other hand, the party wishes to begin reshaping American society from the ground up, turning all into loyal patriots so the threat of betrayal will never come again. No matter who wins the struggle, the consequences will be severe."

Many had believed them to be reactionary despots, but perhaps they had a change of heart? Apparently the CMP didn't fully evaporate upon their takeover, and former CMP voters began to vote for them once more. But something was wrong. Everywhere, opposition parties were unable to secure any seats in the government while the Legionary grip only seemed to get tighter every day. The CMP announced a joint session to announce a plan for the elections of 1940, but something was off. A man who was supposedly a CMP chairman was sitting in the front aisles listening to the candidates give a speech, while holding what seemed to be a radio in his hand. After the speeches were done, he slipped out through the back. The very next day, over 400 arrests had been reported, many of which were the people that were giving the speeches, for supposed “collaboration with terrorists.”

ARA.13.d:0 "An envoy from Indianapolis has arrived in Bismarck, with the request, seeming more like a demand, for our state to be integrated into the so-called American Redemption Authority. Their leaders, namely Lindbergh and Smith, were staunch allies of the business plot, holding true to the ideals of Fordism anti-Zionism. The Legion has offered many of our government and business leaders positions in their cabinet, and our forces will be integrated into their armies. Although we will still have influence in the midwest as well as being part of something greater, this deal effectively will end our sovereignty."
ARA.13.a:0 "No deal!"
ARA.13.b:0 "Deal!"
ARA.14.t:0 "A Stab in the Back"
ARA.14.d:0 "Lindbergh was enraged. After all he had done for MacGuire and the rest of the Business Plot, he responded with this? They have refused our offer for peaceful integration, and are already mobilizing to defend their land. Our former allies were completely unable to see reason. We will have to destroy them, leaving them in the dust like all other traitors."
ARA.14.a:0 "So it has come to this."
ARA.15.t:0 "National Union"
ARA.15.d:0 "The envoy from Bismarck has just arrived, and it appears the Plot is united once more.

ARA.16.d:0 "Michał was hiding inside of his father’s estate. He had known that the Legionnaires were coming to do an “anti-communist inpection”. But he knew this was a lie. They had marched into his home town, and his father had told him to hide inside of the basement. He heard the “inspectors” barge into the home and drag his parents into the street. Along with many of his neighbors, they were all lined up in the street, with riflemen facing them. Michał could not see, nor did he want to, but before the crack of the rifles, he could only hear the commissar yell out one phrase as the top of the basement door was shaken by the marching of boots…"
ARA.16.a:0 "No Mercy!"
ARA.17.t:0 "The Columbus Agreement"
ARA.17.d:0 "A delegation from the government in Indianapolis has sent an ambassador, Henrik Shipstead to pursue further cooperation against the red menace. Their “president” Gerald L. K. Smith has supposedly expressed desires to work together, but this is most certainly Charles Lindbergh’s idea. Lindbergh had served in the Federalist Forces during the 2nd Civil War, and was wounded in combat against the League of Nations. Although he was once loyal to us, his ambitions have become twisted, forming his own demented branch of the Federalist Army. He alongside Smith have come to blame minority groups such as Jews for the 2nd Civil War, and many within out military are repulsed by the extemimist views they hold. However, it may be in our best interests to work with him against Thomas’ socialist hordes, but can we really trust these madmen’s ambitions?"
ARA.17.a:0 "Against the Reds!"

ARA.18.d:0 "Despite our efforts, it appears the egotistical tyrant MacArthur has refused our call to arms against the Reds. He will die alone against the Socialist hordes, leaving us to clean up the bodies."

ARA.19.t:0 "Chaos in Pittsburg"
ARA.19.d:0 "MacArthur had chosen to not delegate the peace terms of the war against the Reds until the fall of Chicago, and now, a Legionary delegation from Indiana had arrived to discuss terms in Pittsburg. Throughout the war, there were numerous incidents of Federal troops getting into “meetings” with Legionary officials, and suspicious movements of troops. However, the meeting was in full place and MacArthur prepared his next meeting with Henrik Shipstead. The meeting seemed normal at first, until the radio began to blare. Reports were coming in of mass mutinies within the Federal army, and forces had begun to overthrow regional governors. Shipstead walked in, and soon after four men walked in behind. “What the hell is the meaning of this, Henrik?”, MacArthur barked. Shipstead didn’t answer, he only glanced and grinned slightly. “Answer me you son of a bitch!” MacArthur yelled. Suddenly, Shipstead whipped out a revolver, firing three times in MacArthur’s direction. The room descended into chaos, as MacArthur attempted to wrestle the gun from Shipstead, and the men inside the room soon began exchanging shots wildly. As the radio continued to blare on about the violent breakdown of the Federal leadership, it became clear that the survivor would determine the fate of the Eastern Defense Command."
ARA.19.a:0 "Shipstead is riddled with bullets! To hell with the Legion!"
ARA.19.b:0 "MacArthur lies dead on the floor! The coup succeeds!"
ARA.20.t:0 "Sic Semper Tyrannis"
ARA.20.d:0 "The Federal forces could resist the advance of the Legion no longer. The Legionaries were advancing closer and closer to Erie, as Federal Command faltered. In the capitol, it had become clear the war was lost. The morale of the people had been faltering ever since the East Coast Intervention and continued tyrannical reign of the Federalists, with the populistic and nationalistic ideals of the Legionaries growing ever more popular and encouraging desertion. MacArthur knew deep down this was his end, but continued to order wave after wave of civilian forces to attempt to resist the Patriotic Legion to no avail. However, Dwight D. Eisenhower had been growing weary of the methods employed by the Federalists. He had sided with MacArthur for the sole purpose of defeating the socialists, always disaproving of the cult MacArthur had seemingly built around himself. However, it was very clear to him now that MacArthur only cared about himself. Not the people. Not democracy. Not America. The suffering of the people must end, and Dwight would be the one to do so. As the Federal command convened one last time to discuss plans of resistance, Dwight had built up dissenting Federal forces against MacArthur’s continued rule. During the meeting, Dwight suddenly sat up, and generals Edwin F. Harding and S.L.A Marshall did as well. Many infantrymen stormed into the room. “MacArthur, by the rights of the American people, you have been convicted of despotism and treason. You are under arrest.” said Ike. MacArthur was in shock. “No. After all I’ve done, this is how you treat me?!” MacArthur screamed. The men began to approach MacArthur to apprehend him, but almost as quickly as they had grabbed him, MacArthur broke free, running straight at Eisenhower. “I’ll kill you if it’s the last thing I do, you fucking traitor dog!”. Eisenhower, upset he could not do this in a more honorable way, drew his pistol, shooting MacArthur twice. The American Caesar dropped dead. Eisenhower then began to prepare a peace agreement with the Legion, to minimize the suffering of the American people."
ARA.20.a:0 "Et tu, Ike?"
ARA.21.t:0 "The End of the Nightmare"
ARA.21.d:0 "The British and French detachment quickly plowed their way into the main gates of the city. Collaborator forces advance into southern Indiana. The once superior air force was quickly downed by RAF planes and French anti air. The collapse of the Legion was inevitable. Rather than face justice by the hands of League, Gerald Smith conducted a final Church session to which he commit suicide after he finished. Lindbergh stood by his men to the end, and was killed by an air strike near the capitol. With their central leaders dead, the men of Indiana surrendered."
ARA.21.a:0 "Ashes to ashes."
