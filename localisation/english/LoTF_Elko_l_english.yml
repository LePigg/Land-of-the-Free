#EVENTS
 elk.1.t:0 "Rebels no More"
 elk.1.d:0 "The petty rebellion that Reno's mayor in the name of "actual and free democracy" has led is now completely destroyed. Why even try if there simply was no chance of winning? With the capture of both Elko and Twin Falls, the rebel forces have been left to starve in the Schell Creek Range. A small group, about a few hundred or so, have descended down the mountains to surrender out of desperation. Of course once we disarmed them, we forced them to dig a pit and we shot the rebels into their own grave. There is no mercy for traitors in the Silver State."
 elk.1.a:0 "I'm not sure what they were expecting"
 elk.2.t:0 "Cutting the Cult"
 elk.2.d:0 "Out of our immediate enemies, the despicable cultists in Eureka are the most deplorable. They subject their civilians to countless experiments and brutal working conditions. It is a miracle that most of the population survived. The most loyal cultists have thrown themselves into our lines to give their leaders enough time to escape into the night. We have reestablished law and order into the anarchy of Northern California for now."
 elk.2.a:0 "They are lucky we saved them"
 elk.3.t:0 "A Nice Meeting"
 elk.3.d:0 "Mencken knew this day would come. All surrounding his great experiment hated him but his fellow americans. McCarran personally ordered Mencken to be freed from jail and to meet him in the Nevada State Capitol in Carson City. "You know, we have a lot in common. Nobody else seems to understand the need for a conservatism force to keep America together. What do you say? My government can forgive you for not yielding and you can have a high government position" said McCarran face to face with his potential ally. "I would never ally with a tyrant like you! Your government is oppressing all that live under your brutality and your red scare is nothing but a ploy to-" Before Mencken could finish his sentence, McCarran give a nod to a guard standing in the back of the room. With no hesitation, the guard pulled out a pistol and shot a hole in the back of Mencken's head."
 elk.3.a:0 "We could have been friends, you know"
 elk.4.t:0 "The Real Reason"
 elk.4.d:0 "The Government of Spokane was extremely suprised to have been invaded. They thought we would liberate them and bring back democracy to the northwest. With Spokane nearly completely looted and destroyed, the government is scared senseless for what we may do. All parts of the former government were erased from history and executed. The reason for this is quite simple; we cannot have competition when it comes to elections. The people can't vote us out if there is no opposition."
 elk.4.a:0 "A shallow grave in the Nevada Desert will do"
 elk.5.t:0 "At Our Mercy"
 elk.5.d:0 "Our worst enemies are now at the mercy of our hands. The communists of Seattle have been utterly defeated by our superior army and professionalism. Our anti-communist and red scare have been a real warning to them. Some communists in their government have fled to the Soviet Union to avoid persecution. For those that stayed, their fate will be rather unfortunate. We must show the people what happens to communists through a public execution. There is no need for a show trial. The penalty for communist activities is always the death penalty."
 elk.5.a:0 "Fear teaches best"
 elk.6.t:0 "Warring States"
 elk.6.d:0 "Our military advisors and leader have unanimously agreed that now is the best time to expand into our neighbors' lands in order to secure our position much better. The war machine has been turned on once again for the better of our country."
 elk.6.a:0 "One step closer to unification"
 elk.7.t:0 "Warring States"
 elk.7.d:0 "Our military advisors and leader have unanimously agreed that now is the best time to expand into our neighbors' lands in order to secure our position much better. The war machine has been turned on once again for the better of our country."
 elk.7.a:0 "One step closer to unification" 
 elk.8.t:0 "McCarran Assassinated!"
 elk.8.d:0 "Our Acting-President Pat McCarran was attacked on the steps of the Nevada state capitol early this week. The assassin was a suspected communist who promptly died in a shoot out with McCarran's body guards. The White Purge seems to have not done enough to remove all communists and socialists from our american soil and McCarran has now paid the price. Joseph McCarthy, Acting-Vice President, has been sworn into office immediately following McCarran was declared dead. For now, he must stabilize and consolidate his rule before he can crackdown further on the vile communists."
 elk.8.a:0 "This can't get worse!"
 elk.9.t:0 "The Republic of Yakima"
 elk.9.d:0 "The forshame republic of Spokane has risen from its grave somehow and retaken our northern border with Canada. Despite our best offers to cooperate with the Republican and Democratic parties, they refused to work with us in the past. Now, they have fled to Yakima along with Lester C. Hunt as their leader."
 elk.9.a:0 "Bastards!"
 elk.10.t:0 "The West Coast People's Republic"
 elk.10.d:0 "Just as we suspected, communists were everywhere. It's like no matter how hard we try, there is no way to remove the red scum off this earth! The number of communists leader we have executed are countless yet they always find a new one. It seems like they have occupied the entire West Coast as no contact with our local governments could be made there."
 elk.10.a:0 "Fuckers!"
 elk.11.t:0 "The Air Force Secedes!"
 elk.11.d:0 "McCarran was known for his love and interest in aviation, but now it has come to haunt us. They deemed our quest to remove the communist cells 'unpatriotic' and 'pyschopathic.' They have taken matters into their own hands and occupied Oregon and Boise. We even graciously tried negociating with them, yet they bombed any attempt of reasoning."
 elk.11.a:0 "What the hell!"
 elk.12.t:0 "Partisans Resilient"
 elk.12.d:0 "Our detachment of some of most trained and finest men were brutally ambushed on their way to the objective. They put up a good fight, but ultimately failed to destroy the rebellion in the selected state. We will have to gear up a new army group and launch another attack some other time."
 elk.12.a:0 "Terrible!"
 elk.13.t:0 "Northern California Secured"
 elk.13.d:0 "Good news President McCarthy! Our strong and mighty forces have completely reconnected with the rest of the remaining government in Northern California and business is back as usual."
 elk.13.a:0 "Good to know"
 elk.14.t:0 "Oregon Secured"
 elk.14.d:0 "Good news President McCarthy! Our strong and mighty forces have completely reconnected with the rest of the remaining government in Oregon and business is back as usual."

 elk.16.a:0 "Good to know"
 elk.17.t:0 "Victorious"
 elk.17.d:0 "We have fully secured our total control over Cascadia. Acting-President McCarthy can now finally finish the White Purge with total stability."
 elk.17.a:0 "What McCarran would have wanted"
