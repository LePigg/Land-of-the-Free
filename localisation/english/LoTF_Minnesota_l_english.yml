#EVENTS
 min.1.t:0 "In the Name of Preserving Democracy"
min.1.d:0 "As the Red Tide swept through America following the tragedy of January 21st, Minnesota governor Floyd Olson, managed to prevent his state from flipping over to the CMP by pushing populist policies under the Farmer Labor Party while also appealing to local conservatives. Once the Federalist Rebellion began, the state of Minnesota under Olson declared neutrality in the impending civil war, opting to serve neither side so that America would not fall to radicalism. However, the state soon became crippled as pro-socialist protestors under the leadership of Farrell Dobbs launched strikes in the factories and called for alignment with Norman’s government. Olson called for Minnesota National Guardsmen Ellard A. Walsh to declare martial law, sending in the guard to break up the strikes and crush the protests. In this moment of weakness, the Chicago Government launched an expedition led by General Mark Clark to dispose of Olson, hoping the war would be easy due to the perceived solidarity of the Minnesota working class, but as the people of Minnesota began to mobilize against the invaders, the socialist forces were routed. The national guard managed to cut Clark’s army in half, forcing them into a disorganized retreat into Wisconsin, and the remaining Dobbs loyalists began a long march into the cold north. As the Socialists and Federalists ultimately collapsed, Minnesota has assured itself to inherit the ideals America was founded on, seeking to rebuild the nation freer than ever before."
min.1.a:0 "Can the American Experiment hold?"
min.2.t:0 "An Outreach from the Twin Cities"
min.2.d:0 "A group of extremely well-dressed men were found wandering the streets of Chicago completely confused about where our provisional capitol building is. After a brief interrogation from the People’s Chicago Police Department, they turn out to be diplomats from the Twin Cities looking to talk to our government. From a personal request from Governor Olson, he wishes to introduce cooperation between our two states in hopes of mutual assistance in times of need. Although we do not see eye to eye at best about how to bring about a socialist revolution to the United States, his government and party is the closest we have to a friend. Let us not forget that he refused to deploy the Minnesota National Guard to help us combat the Federalists during the Second American Civil War. The specifics of cooperation were not given so we have the power to decide how friendly we want to be towards them."
min.2.a:0 "If they didn’t help us before, why would they help us now?" 
min.2.b:0 "Let’s just lighten the troops on their border for now"
min.2.c:0 "Send them some government assistance. We will take any ally at this point."
min.3.t:0 "Chicago Refuses!"
min.3.d:0 "Our detachment of diplomats have returned home with bad news. The President of Chicago has refused any cooperation between our two governments citing that our refusal to help them during the Civil War showed our potential disloyalty. From what our men say, they are even lucky that they weren’t forced to travel back home on foot or by horse. That being said, it seems like we will have to continue to survive by ourselves."
min.3.a:0 "Well we didn't need them anyways!"
min.4.t:0 "Chicago agrees to a neutrality pact!"
min.4.d:0 "Our detachment of diplomats have returned home with great news. The President of Chicago has agreed to starting diplomatic ties between our two governments despite our rocky relationship before. From now on, we will be able to pass equipment and manpower across the Mississippi to help each other in times of need. Let us make a toast to our friends down in Chicago."
min.4.a:0 "Great!"
min.5.t:0 "The Brewing Storm"
min.5.d:0 "It was only a few years ago when the Federalists launched their offensive towards Chicago. It failed with a complete disaster, forcing MacNider to retreat to the lands of Iowa. The Federalists simply ousted the local government, proclaiming martial law until further notice. The Federalists do not care much for Iowans as they had overwhelmingly voted for the Democratic-Socialist coalition of 1932 and the locals hate them back equally for their military presence. Those seeds of discontent have finally grown to a breaking point in which the local pro-democratic population, led by former Governor Clyde Herring, are planning to launch a coup against the Federalists. At this point, we must make up with the public and support this cause. If we are able to overthrow the Federalists in Iowa, we can potentially gain an ally. On the other hand, the coup has a realistic chance of failing and our involvement in it may bring the conflict to our doorstep. After all, the Federalists are more experienced and are remnants of the old United States military; they could easily invade if they wanted to."
min.5.a:0 "The Righteous Crusade has begun"
min.5.b:0 "Iowa is a lost cause"
min.6.t:0 "Election Season of 1936"
min.6.d:0 "Floyd Olson’s health is no secret: the governor has been unable to carry out his normal duties and has been making less public appearances. As a result, he has decided to no longer seek to pursue reelection, and now the FLP must nominate a new governor. Although the Republicans have gained strength over the past year, we still hold a supermajority in the state. Currently, most of the hardline Olsonists have backed Ellard A. Walsh, who has effectively served as Olson’s second in command ever since the strikes of mid 1935 as well as having much influence over the National Guard which he commands. He seeks to continue Olson’s legacy of being America’s moderate bloc, taking a hardline stance against the remnants of the so called “Minnesota Red Army” in Duluth while continuing the populist policies Olson has pushed. However, lieutenant governor Hjalmar Petersen has pursued a different path. He seeks to reform the party back to its leftist roots and pursuing labor reform. Controversy, he seeks reconciliation with Dobbs’ rogue state, hoping to see the conflict between our two regimes end without bloodshed. Now these two men are locked in a power struggle to succeed Olson, and now they initiate their campaigns to succeed our beloved governor."
min.6.a:0 "Take the party on a path to reform!"
min.6.b:0 "Uphold Olson's Legacy!"
min.7.t:0 "Terror in Des Moines"
min.7.d:0 "Another protest in Des Moines sprung up again. This time tensions grew to an all time high. After several hours of intense standoff between the protestors and the nation guard, a gun shot went off. Nobody knows which sides fired first, but the 'peaceful' demonstration had turned violent. The people are losing confidence of our ability to hold the state together!"
min.7.a:0 "It wasn't even our fault!"
min.8.t:0 "The Minnesota Grubernatorial Election of 1936"
min.8.d:0 "With the day of election arriving and Olson’s subsequent resignation as governor due to health concerns, the time to appoint a successor has arrived. After fervent campaigning, the FLP decides that..."
min.8.a:0 "Walsh will succeed Olson."
min.8.b:0 "Petersen takes over party leadership."
min.9.t:0 "The Aftermath"
min.9.d:0 "The border conflict is over and now its time to clean up this mess. We lost many, but we learned much more. Let us make sure the mistakes made won't happen again."
min.9.a:0 "Time to inform the widows..."
min.10.t:0 "The Aftermath"
min.10.d:0 "The border conflict is over and we lost. Badly. Our food silos and caches were raided. Our men are dead; if not, they are tired and hungry. What are we going to do?"
min.10.a:0 "...Tell the public"
min.10.b:0 "...Censor this event"
min.11.t:0 "Extending the Olive Branch"
min.11.d:0 "Perhaps slaughtering and waging war with the traitors in Duluth will tarnish our reputation. Maybe we can work out a deal with Dobbs in which they would recieve amnesty in exchange for surrending Duluth?"
min.11.a:0 "Send a convoy and let's see"
min.12.t:0 "The Response"
min.12.d:0 "Dobbs has suprisingly accept our offer and are willing to cooperate!"
min.12.a:0 "No blood will be shed today"
min.13.t:0 "The Response"
min.13.d:0 "The socialists unsuprisingly refused our offer and killed our convoy. This is enough justification for war."
min.13.a:0 "To Duluth!"
min.14.t:0 "A Convoy From Minneapolis"
min.14.d:0 "A convoy from Minnesota has arrived surprisingly peaceful. They basically have an ultimatum to give us. The deal offers amnesty and concessions in exchange for controller over the major cities. Should we take the deal?"
min.14.a:0 "Yes, it's better than nothing"
min.14.b:0 "To arms men! We must make our last stand!"
min.15.t:0 "A talk with the Ojibwe Council"
min.15.d:0 ""I'm very glad we could come to an agreement," [Root.GetLeader] said as he saw surveyors map out the thousands of acres of land that would be controlled by the Ojibwe. "I hope we can co-exist peacefully," a tribal member spoke out nervous of remembering all the other times Minnesota had given them emptied promises."
min.15.a:0 "Only time will tell"
min.16.t:0 "The Trial of the Business Men"
min.16.d:0 ""Macguire, you have been charged with treason and been found guilty," the judge read aloud. As the news was spread across the state, there was an uproar of what the punishment should be. The Dakotans and Natives are crying for execution at the very least even though the Abolition bill of 1911 banned the death penalty in Minnesota. Should we follow the people or the law?"
min.16.a:0 "Give them a life-time imprisonment without the possibility of parole"
min.16.b:0 "Execute these traitors"
min.17.t:0 "Bismarck Up in Flames"
min.17.d:0 "The men of North Dakota fought with all they had, but could not defeat our forces. Once again, their hopes have been crushed and they have been pushed to the back pages of American history. Minnesotan troops marched through their cities with pride as the Dakotan army disintegrated."
min.17.a:0 "A helpless situation"
min.18.t:0 "A Trip to Bismarck"
min.18.d:0 "[Root.GetLeader] took the passenger flight from the Twin Cities to Bismarck for negociation. It was clearly better than throwing his army at the enemy. Langer simply wanted guarantees that he would be allowed to continue his governorship in the new Union. [Root.GetLeader] was eager to accept the offer."
min.18.a:0 "A win-win situation, but it will take time bridge our differences"
min.19.t:0 "The Decentralization Act"
min.19.d:0 "This Act will ensure that governors and state government duties will not be infringed. In addition, this bill has reserved large annual funding for North Dakota's finances. This will help the integration process for incoming states and please Langer."
min.19.a:0 "Better than needlessly spilling blood"
min.20.t:0 "Day Break"
min.20.d:0 "Jackson spent each day toiling in the Steel Works Factory in Suoux Falls. Miserable wages, miserable hours, miserable workers. His life revolved around his job and his job engulfed his entire life. Those guards in the factory; always watching with their index finger on the trigger just in case one of the workers falls out of line. In these past few months, Jackson had noticed that the guard count had slowly been decreasing. Rumours had spread that the government was failing to beat another warlord. Eventually, only the factory manager and his assistants remained as the only overseers. Today, they didn't even show up. Jackson and his colleagues continued to clock in and work; afterall, this could be some strange test set up by the boss. Just then, a group of trucks rolled into the back garage of the factory. He couldn't believe it. The day has come. Men with the Minnesota Insignia hopped out. One of them adjusted his glasses and took out a piece of paper from his pocket. He began to announce: 'You all are hereby citizens of the State of Minnesota and thus free of any bondage or obligations tied to the Plot's Government.'"
min.20.a:0 "Jackson cried tears of joy for the first time"
min.21.t:0 "Beyond the Mississippi"
min.21.d:0 "The devils that once occupied South Dakota and the tyrant in Des Moines are dead. Even though Minnesota and her neighboring states have been liberated from despots and dictators, the rest of America isn't. Our generals have come to the consensus to swiftly move east across the Mississippi River and into the Rust Belt. The warlords in those states are much more powerful, but the opportunity to control the heart of industrial America is too good to pass up. Among the warlords are the two factions that sparked the Second American Civilwar: Chicago and Erie. Norman Thomas and the rest of the last legitimate remnants of the United States. Although we may not be on the great terms, they are closest aligned to our cause for continuing to uphold elections. General MacArthur still leads the Federalist movement and controls one of the strongest armies east of us. We may have caused the demise of MacNider's army, but MacArthur may be willing to work with us to save the Union. Both factions detest each other and we must support one side to prevent the spillage of more blood."
min.21.a:0 "Let President Thomas know that he has our support."
min.21.b:0 "[ERR.GetLeader] will have the backing of our government."
min.21.c:0 "We will not help anyone who betrays America!"
min.22.t:0 "Minneapolis Proposes as Pact"
min.22.d:0 "Beyond the bloody Great Lakes, the Minneapolis government controls the Midwest Region. They have approached us with an opportunity for mutual assistance. We will help each other in times of a defensive war. While we were not on the best of terms prior to the Second American Civilwar, it is in our absolute interest to have an ally or at least a useful temporary tool before we betray their trust."
min.22.a:0 "Good to know"
min.23.t:0 "Chicago Accepts Unification!"
min.23.d:0 "Norman Thomas and his government has accepted our deal to unify our two countries together! Let us celebrate that there will be no bloodshed tonight."
min.23.a:0 "A step closer to a united America"
min.24.t:0 "Chicago Declines Unification!"
min.24.d:0 "Norman Thomas and his government has thrown our deal in the trash and refuses to negociate any furthing citing that the Free Midwestern Republic is a traitorous and rebellious state that will be put down."
min.24.a:0 "They forced our hand"
min.25.t:0 "The Invention of SPAM"
min.25.d:0 "In quiet city of Austin in southern Minnesota, the small business Hormel Foods Corporation has created SPAM. Made from the main ingredient of pork, SPAM is promised to last several years and through rough conditions. Jay Hormel, the inventor of the meat, claims that SPAM can be used as a protein substitute for when field kitchens are lacking. This revolutionary preserved meat will surely help us in the battlefield."
min.25.a:0 "Say, what's really in SPAM anyways?"
min.26.t:0 "Stomach Cancer"
min.26.d:0 "The several years that Olson had to lead the Republic through the Second American Civil War had taken a toll on his health. His stomach cancer became worse and worse by the months as he toiled to uphold democracy in America. Last night, he passed away at the Rochester Mayo Clinic after months of treatment. His right-hand man, Petersen, will take his place as the leader of the Farmer-Labor Party."
min.26.a:0 ""This has got me. Don't worry; it must be all for the best.""
min.27.t:0 "Election Season of 1940"
min.27.d:0 "The FLP has managed to win the previous election and continued to to grow in popularity even after our beloved Governor Olson succumbed to stomach cancer a few years back. Despite other parties beginning to increase in popularity, Henry Wallace is confident that the FLP will win the election once again. Once again, the main opposition is the Republican Party. Harold Stassen leads the conservative wing once again, but a new faction of the Republican Party has began to form: the Militarists. Spearheaded by the very brief Secretary of State of the Roosevelt-Norman Administration, Cordell Hull aims to completely militarize the fledgling republic in order to protect it from potential enemies. Unlike the Federalists, Hull believes in upholding democracy above all. Lastly, the New Democratic Party has appeared in public eye after Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of the late President Franklin Roosevelt, arrived in the Republic. She campaigns on fulfilling her husband's New Deal and lifting the Republic out of the economic depression. This election is more important than ever before as the Republic turns from a two party system and into a flourishing multiparty democracy."

For the past few months, ever since he was pushed out of the governor’s mansion in Madison, he had been operating out of an impromptu building in Eau Claire. He checked the clock - 2 A.M - He sighed, knowing tomorrow would be exactly the same. Then suddenly, the door slammed open, and he snapped up to see one of his interns. He immediately saw the dread on their face and knew what it was about.“We just received a letter for you, it’s uh, it’s about your brother.” Philip picked up the letter and shooed away the intern. A minute later, he was sobbing on his desk, Clark had caught him, that fucking bastard. And now he was to be held on trial in the coming years. Why, why did have to be him, Philip asked himself.

 minnesota.20.d:0 "The several years that Olson had to lead Minnesota through the Collapse had taken a toll on his health.
