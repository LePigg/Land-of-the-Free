#EVENTS
mjv.1.t:0 "Long Way from Home"
mjv.1.d:0 "It has been at least half a decade now since the Capone has been arrested for tax evasion. It was essentially a show trial as the government needed a scapegoat to keep themselves in office. Obviously, Capone was given the heaviest sentence and was sent to Alcatraz. Of course with Capone gone, the average american's situation remained stagnant. Al Capone continued to rot away in the isolated hell hole of a prison while America continued to rot from its inside. The Second American Civil War sweeped the nation, causing the state of California to collapse. With no authority in the prison, Capone made the daring attempt to flee the island and away from San Francisco. Al Capone tried as he might, but no warlord or provisional government accepted him; the only place nearby left was the unforgiving Mojave Desert. Now stuck in Barstow and no way of returning home, Capone plans to rebuild his former mafia rempire in a completely new environment."
mjv.1.a:0 "A Wild Ride" 
mjv.3.t:0 "Mojave: Food for Payment"
mjv.3.d:0 "A convoy from the Mojave territory has apporached our border guards with a trade proposal. They are willing to give payments in terms of gold and political power in exchange for the plentiful foo we produce. Currently, they are asking for 180 days worth of food for their people and in return, we will recieve a payment of around 3 truckloads of gold and 80 political power. Should we accept this offer?"
mjv.3.a:0 "Accept the offer"
mjv.3.b:0 "Decline the offer"
mjv.4.t:0 "Processing the Deal"

mjv.5.a:0 "Where are we supposed to get food now?"
mjv.6.t:0 "Food Silos Raided!"
mjv.6.d:0 "Reports from rural communities and farming towns have shown that massive amounts of food supply have been stolen. The main suspect is the Mojave warlord who have stolen livestock and grain. Our local garrions tried as they might, but ultimately failed to defend it."
mjv.6.a:0 "Damn!"
mjv.7.t:0 "An Attempted Raid"
mjv.7.d:0 "Reports from rural communities and farming towns have shown scars of an attempted robbery.

mjv.14.t:0 "Governmental Collapse!"
mjv.14.d:0 "The people of our lands are fed up with the shortage of food and are knocking at our doors. There is nothing more we can do but to flee this wretched land. Capone and company will have to flee before they are caught by the angry local population."
mjv.14.a:0 "So long..."
mjv.15.t:0 "Power Vacuum in the Mojave"
mjv.15.d:0 "The news of Al Capone and his goonies fleeing the Mojave was quick to spreak across California.

Now, the whole desert is ours though we now have the burden of caring for the people."
mjv.15.a:0 "Great news"
mjv.16.t:0 "Raiding Attempt!"
mjv.16.d:0 "The Mojave raiders have once again tried to raid and plunder our lands. Our brave soldiers put up a good fight and warded off the aggressors. Tonight, we sleep soundly knowingly that the Mojave won't be back for a while."

mjv.17.t:0 "Weapon Caches Taken!"
mjv.17.d:0 "The Mojave raiders have once again raided and plundered our lands. Our brave soldiers put a good fight, but were sadly overrun by the swarm of aggressors.

mjv.17.a:0 "Dear God!"
mjv.18.t:0 "Gold Reserves Looted!"
mjv.18.d:0 "The Mojave raiders have once again raided and plundered our lands. Our brave soldiers put a good fight, but were sadly overrun by the swarm of aggressors. After the raid, inventory of our stockpile showed the raiders stole vast amounts of our gold reserves and valuables. Tonight, we cower in fear; if our soldiers can't fend off the deranged mafia, who can?"
mjv.18.a:0 "Dear God!"
mjv.19.t:0 "Utter Failure!"
mjv.19.d:0 "Our men failed to capture the objective and were promptly pushed back into the desert. In the end, they failed to secure any loot. Several of our men are either killed in action or still missing."

mjv.22.t:0 "Order Lost!"
mjv.22.d:0 "John Garand has personally contacted Al Capone with the terrible news that our order for new weapons was abushed on its route to Barstow. As a gesture of good will, Garand offers a return of half of our gold, but refuses to refund our order."
mjv.22.a:0 "He's joking right?"
mjv.23.t:0 "Order Delayed"
mjv.23.d:0 "John Garand has personally contacted Al Capone with the terrible news that our order will be delayed due to logistic problems. He reassures us that this time, the weapons delivery will be delivered, just a month late."
mjv.23.a:0 "Fine"
mjv.24.t: "Order Arrival"
mjv.24.d:0 "After much long waiting, our order for weapons from Albuquerque has finally arrived. Now, we can finally arm our men and keep our raiding lifestyle alive for another day."
mjv.24.a:0 "Great!"
mjv.25.t:0 "Grand Reopening"
mjv.25.d:0 "Before the American Second Civil War, Las Vegas was filled with promise and prosperity. It served as the getaway vacation city for many in the tri state area and generated the state of Nevada a great lump sum of money. Unfortunately, the grand days were abruptly ended when the Second American Civil War stopped all visitors from coming. As government leaders turned traitors started to secede, the mayor of Las Vegas refused to join McCarran's Cascadia or Sinclair's California. Opting to stay loyal to the Western Defence Command, Las Vegas began expeditions to securing the dangerous borderlands nearby until the WDC itself was forced to withdrawl from Las Vegas. Left alone to rot and decay, Las Vegas was abandoned and surrendered to local bandits running small cliques of their own. Now, Al Capone and company have cleared out the city of bandits and are giving the city a second life. Business and profits are slowly picking up speed and will surpass the Roaring 20s presitge it once had."
mjv.25.a:0 "Back in Business!"
mjv.26.t:0 "The Hoover Dam"
mjv.26.d:0 "The construction project known as the Hoover Dam has finally been completed. Although most of it was built before we even reached Barstow, we have the credit of finishing what the federal government once started half a decade ago. With this slab of concrete that stops the mighty Colorado River, we are able to direct water for agriculture and sanctioning our undesirable neighbors. In addition, this new source of electricity will make Las Vegas fully independent from outside power! Nothing can stop us now but ourselves."
mjv.26.a:0 "Well done gentlemen"
mjv.28.t:0 "Despite Our Defeat"
mjv.28.d:0 "Although we did get pushed back to our lands and suffered defeat, the morale of our men is always high. We will learn what we can from this disaster and carry on."
mjv.28.a:0 "Oh well"
