 CAL_centralization_desc:0 "As the administrators of vast territories with a hostile population, we exert very small control over the lands we occupy. With most power being in the hands of local politicians and law enforcement. However, we slowly gain better and better control over these groups the longer we administer the regions.\n\nThis ongoing process of §CCentralization§! is key to our long term success, as it will be the foundation upon which any future plans for expansion will be laid.\n\n§9Our bureaucratic administration will gain influence in each state by 10% every month. By enacting various decisions we can either speed up the centralization process or use our current Administrative strength to construct valuable industry in the area.§!"
