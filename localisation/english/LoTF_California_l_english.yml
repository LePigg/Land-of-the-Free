#EVENTS
cal.x.t:0 "The Japanese Launch a Coup!"
cal.x.d:0 "Somehow, the Japanese have undermined our authority to a breaking point. Over the past months, they have gained enough support and equipment to take over our capitol. Senator Johnson and company have been executed in the state capital and the japanese have created a new puppet state as their stepping stone for direct intervention in California."
cal.x.a:0 "And the torch of freedom dies out."
cal.x.t:0 "Surrounding the Bay"
cal.x.d:0 "The Golden State has been tarnished to a small rump state surrounding the San Fransico Bay. Frank Merriam has been the sole reason our legitamite state has not been completely obliterated by the technocrats and socialists down south. The moment Hiram Johnson arrived in California, Merriam was more than happy to give the reins of control to him; hopefully, he has the ability to bring back our state to its formal glory. This means even working with the Japanese to get a leverage. We must be careful though, giving them too much information and control may led to dastardly consequences."
cal.x.a:0 "Californian Sunshine"
cal.x.t:0 "Talking with Rossi"
cal.x.d:0 "The Monterey Region of our domain was given to Angelo Rossi in exchange for direct control of San Fransico. Lately, many in the Sacramento Government are speculating that Rossi has turned his administrative region into his own playground has we rarely recieve any reports or requests from there. Rossi is now asking that we send him monthl payments for the reason of "security purposes." He threatens succession if we don't comply."
cal.x.a:0 "Give him what he wants"
cal.x.b:0 "Why would we pay a hedonist?"
cal.x.t:0 "Collaborators No More"
cal.x.d:0 "The time has come. No more will we bend our beliefs and ideals to the Japanese. Hiram Johnson has issued an executive order. All Japanese advisors must leave now or face severe punishments. This will severely hurt us, but it is all worth it in the name of democracy."
cal.x.a:0 "Can't trust the damn Japs!"
cal.x.t:0 "From Sacramento, With Love"
cal.x.d:0 "A telegram from Sacramento has sent us an offer of unification between our two democratic city states. Do we accept?"
cal.x.a:0 "Democracy works best when we all work together"
cal.x.b:0 "We would never work with collaborators!"
cal.x.t:0 "Huxley Accepts!"
cal.x.d:0 "Good news has arrived! Huxley is willing to unite our forces together to fight for the common cause of democracy."
cal.x.a:0 "Great!"
cal.x.t:0 "Huxley Refuses!"
cal.x.d:0 "Huxley has refused any attempts at unification, citing that we worked with the fascist Japanese to get to where we are today."
cal.x.a:0 "Wartime again"
cal.x.t:0 "Extending the Olive Branch"
cal.x.d:0 "We will try to contact Aldous Huxley to try to unite our two nations together. Let us hope this works out so there is no bloodshed."
cal.x.a:0 "From Sacramento, With Love"
cal.x.t:0 "Rossi Defects!"
cal.x.d:0 "As it turns out, the payments we give him isn't enough to keep him satisfied. He has cut all ties with us and left us with one message; "You should have never taken San Fransico.""
cal.x.a:0 "Motherfucker"
cal.x.t:0 "Japan Undermines Our Power Again"
cal.x.d:0 "Through several connections and corrupt politicans, the Japanese have gained increasing control of our government. Something must be done before it is too late."
cal.x.a:0 "Again?"
cal.x.t:0 "Warring States"
cal.x.d:0 "Our military advisors and leader have unanimously agreed that now is the best time to expand into our neighbors' lands in order to secure our position much better. The war machine has been turned on once again for the better of our country."
cal.x.a:0 "One step closer to unification"
