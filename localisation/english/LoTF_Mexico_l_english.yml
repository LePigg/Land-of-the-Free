#Events
mexico.1.t:0 "The First Test"
mexico.1.d:0 "We have defeated all our fellow americans in this great powerstruggle to regain control of the nation. The only continental lands left in imperialist hands are those occupied by Mexico and the mandates west of the Ohio River. We are currently in no position to retake the East Coast but we should be able to take on Mexico. We must free our fellow americans in Gadsden and Trans-Pecos!"
mexico.1.a:0 "Rally our men!"
mexico.2.t:0 "From: The United States - An Olive Branch"
mexico.2.d:0 "The last warlord standing that currently occupied the west United States has formally asked us for the return of "their" lands. They claim the Gadsden Purchase and Trans-Pecos. We have two choices. We can either transfer the lands peacefully and hope to build a future peaceful relationship or reject their request which may result in war. If we were to accept the transfer of land, the diplomats have promised to invest heavily in underdeveloped lands of our county."

mexico.2.b:0 "Refuse their request"

mexico.4.d:0 "Local government in states bordering the United States have reported a mass-coordinated sabotage of major infrastructure.

mexico.4.a:0 "Damn yankees!"
mexico.5.t:0 "Factories Sabotaged!"
mexico.5.d:0 "Mexico City has been attacked by american terrorists this week. Factories across the city have been blown to pieces and casaulties of this act of terrorism are still being counted. The public are now demanding that we take action against the rogue americans."

mexico.6.t:0 "Build Up on the Border"
mexico.6.d:0 "The vile [From.GetName] has started moving a significant amount of troops to our border. Informants are warning of war and recommend we put our troops to the border also. We must prepare for this threat and repell the invaders from our lands!"
mexico.6.a:0 "We must act quickly!"
mexico.7.t:0 "Mexico Offers Conditional Surrender"
mexico.7.d:0 "Mexican diplomats have approached us requesting a ceasefire. The mexican people have had enough. Mexico is willing to agree to the following terms: Gadsden and Trans-Pecos will be ceded to us in exchange for ceasefire. Should we accept these terms or should we continue our campaign? The mexican population will increase support for its government as we continued our conquest."
mexico.7.a:0 "Accept the peace deal"
mexico.7.b:0 "Keep pushing!"
mexico.8.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses Our Terms!"

mexico.8.a:0 "At least the people have our back this time!"
mexico.9.t:0 "Mexico Offers Conditional Surrender"
mexico.9.d:0 "Mexican diplomats have approached us requesting a ceasefire. The mexican people have had enough.

mexico.11.t:0 "Unconditional Surrender"
mexico.11.d:0 "There is nothing left for us to do. Our military might has disintegrated because we severely underestimated Mexico and its people. We have to submit to them under unconditional surrender. Let us pray that better times are ahead of us."
mexico.11.a:0 "How humiliating!"
mexico.12.t:0 "Mexico Offers Total Surrender"
mexico.12.d:0 "Mexican diplomats have approached us requesting a ceasefire. The mexican people have had enough.

mexico.13.a:0 "This will not sit well with the people!"
mexico.14.t:0 "Riots!"
mexico.14.d:0 "Oaxaca and San Luis Potosi are up in flames currently as protests against the Treaty of Flagstaff turn into violent riots.

This week's total civilian and police casualties: 213."
mexico.14.a:0 "Everyone just calm down!"
mexico.15.t:0 "The Beginning of the End"
mexico.15.d:0 "Following the humiliating loss against the Americans in the 2nd Intervention it appears our national integrity is forever shattered. Massive waves of unrest and anger towards the government have rocked the nation and the police are either unable or unwilling to stop it. Martial law has been declared, but so far we have only been able to secure the heart of Mexico, with the rest of the nation falling into anarchy. Upon our failure to contain the populace, separatists in Yucatán have secured the loyalty of both the populace and the military units of the area, allowing them to declare secession from Mexico. Government forces sent in to reclaim Yucatán have ceased communication, and it appears that many have used the chance to begin a revolution in Oaxaca. Defecting military units released communist politicians arrested during the Calles presidency and declared a socialist revolution determined to bring the teachings of Marx and Lenin to Mexico. It appears our troubles have only begun."

mexico.15.ba:0 "Long live the revolution! (Play as Oaxaca)" 
mexico.15.ca:0 "Secure the northern garrisons"
mexico.16.t:0 "The Tragedy Continues"
mexico.16.d:0 "Following the southern disaster, it appears that government forces heading north to secure the northern states have failed. In the midst of the chaos Pancho Villa, who had been exiled, has returned to Zacatecas, and has rallied the people around him to continue the Revolution of 1915. Pledging loyalty to the ideas of socialism, his control of the state is undeniable and many of our former military forces have already joined his new army. Imperial loyalists from the short-lived 2nd empire have managed to gain enough support to overthrow the government of Tamaulipas and establish a regency for who they believe is the true monarch of Mexico. To the west, the local cartels, who had already controlled much influence of the state of Jalisco, have overthrown the governor of the state and began to exploit the land for increased production of narcotics. With the north firmly out of our control, the president has ordered any remaining loyal forces to focus on defending the capital."

mexico.16.da:0 "We must hold on! (Play as Mexico City)"
mexico.17.t:0 "The Final Moments"
mexico.17.d:0 "With the remnants of the federal army fleeing to the capital, the surrounding areas have ceased to be under our control. With the end of the Calles regime, the Cristeros have taken over the state of Guerrero to continue their holy war. To the north, the more radical Synarchists have couped the government of Leon, seeking to create an ultra nationalist state united through the church and loyalty. And it appears that our German allies have betrayed us, as the Veracruz garrison sent for a military mission has seized the chance and overrun the entire city and the rest of the coast, preparing to grow the German sphere. With no where else to run, all remaining loyal forces have secured the capital from the rebel forces, but we are still in complete disarray. Demoralized and shattered, our nation lies in ruins, and it appears things may only get even worse from here. The battle for Mexico has begun."

mexico.26.d:0 "[From.GetNameDEF] has once again mutilated the corpse of Mexico by stealing the great city of Cancun. There is nothing we can do to take back the city or else we may face total annihilation."
mexico.26.answer:0 "Can we ever catch a break?"
mexico.21.t:0 "A Window of Opportunity"
mexico.21.d:0 "The unexpected collapse of Mexico has given us one last opportunity to steal more land. Yucatan has been completely cut off from Mexico City and the city of Cancun is ripe for the taking. This city is perfect as a naval base to guard the gulf of Mexico and to block off Mexico from the outside world."
mexico.21.answer:0 "Send in our men"
mexico.22.t:0 "Cancun Secured"
mexico.22.d:0 "With the weak garrison still stationed at Cancun, they showed little to no resistance when our american boots hit the beach."
mexico.22.answer:0 "Great!"
mexico.23.t:0 "Defeat in Cancun"
mexico.23.d:0 "Tried all we might, the local Yucatan forces have repelled our small invasion force off the beaches."
mexico.23.answer:0 "Fine!"
mexico.24.t:0 "Intervention in Texas"
mexico.24.d:0 "Reports have shown that a large scale civil war has started in Texas. We can choose to support any of the warlords or choose to do nothing. Intervening in the war would be unproductive as we are extremely unstable ourselves. We will send 1000 guns to our choosen recipient."
mexico.24.aa:0 "Support the Texan Black Army"
mexico.24.ba:0 "Support Dallas"
mexico.24.ca:0 "Support Houston"
mexico.24.da:0 "Support Austin"
mexico.25.t:0 "Mysterious Benefactor"
mexico.25.d:0 "An anonymous shipment has been delivered to our capital today. A convoy of trucks and guns in their trunks have been left abandoned. It seems like some group is supporting our cause secretly. It doesn't matter who it is for now we can finally supply our troops."
mexico.25.aa:0 "Thanks whoever you are"
