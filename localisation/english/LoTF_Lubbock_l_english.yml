anr.1.t:0 "Black Flag Over Texas"
anr.1.d:0 "Nicola Sacco walked through the quiet fields where battle had once lurked. They had come so far. Through the valiant efforts of his comrades they triumphed over the statist hordes and established a Texas on the basis of true freedom. At least, this is what he had hoped. It was clear to him, clear to everyone, that they had not won yet, for already this society was beginning to collapse from the inside. Banditry was rampant, with communes being constantly attacked by plunderers. The communal administration itself was completely overstretched, with vast swathes of land being either unadministered or even worse, reverting back to statism as reactionaries attempted to reinstate their old way of life. When Sacco first led the anarchist revolution from Lubbock, he had promised that once the statists were crushed he would resign as the leader of the movement to show that no man was above another. But with the inability for the communes to make up their minds on how to deal with these newfound problems, Sacco was forced to make a tough decision. He announced over the radio that he would not step down as leader of the communes, and would become the temporary Chief of the Communes until the threats were squashed. He promised that the power of the communes would still be respected, but as Chief of the Communes he would be allowed to make decisions on a scale beyond them. This was meant with mixed reaction, as many still viewed him as a hero and were willing to keep him as the only man above other men, but others were outraged and called him a sham, referring to him as a “statist in anarchist clothing”. Despite this, Sacco has already issued an order that the Texan Black Army will move into crush the bandits and statist remnants to ensure the integrity of the revolution. It was a journey the CMP started, and one Sacco would finish."
anr.1.a:0 "The path of a free man is not an easy one."
anr.2.t:0 "Commune Requests Additional Funding"
anr.2.d:0 "With a sense of prosperity being formed in the air, the people of a local commune have cited their recent works in constructing a brand new industrial center with the help of nearby communes. We could order the local communes to assist in their construction, or we could conserve the political and economic resources for such an action."
anr.2.a:0 "Grant them the desired funds."
anr.2.b:0 "They can handle it on their own."
anr.3.t:0 "Black Army Requests Increased Drafting"
anr.3.d:0 "The Black Army has cited that the statist threat is not fully gone, and we must conscript more men into the militias in order to ensure that the standing Black Army is sufficient to resist the statist hordes. Although this would help in our defense, it may be a gross overextension of our power."
anr.3.a:0 "Send out the draft cards!"
anr.3.b:0 "Let the communes determine conscription."
anr.4.t:0 "Reports of Corruption"
anr.4.d:0 "Disturbing reports lately have shown how a local commune is beginning to exploit the system, to the benefit of the few instead of the many. This is a great insult to us, but our choices on what to do against this evil is split. One faction of the army wishes to send a detachment to brutally crush these traitors, but this could make us look no better than the statists. We could let the corruption slide for our own benefit, but it would hurt our legitimacy."
anr.4.a:0 "Let's see them try to exploit a detachment!"
anr.4.b:0 "This is not our problem."
anr.5.t:0 "General Strike in a Factory"
anr.5.d:0 "As a result of cronyism and despotism in a local factory, many workers have refused to return to work. This is crippling the industry of the area, but the workers claim the communal council is not protecting their rights. We could force the council to cave to the worker demands, but it will be costly. Alternatively, we could rally a local militia force to “convince” the strikers to get back to work."
anr.5.a:0 "Make the concessions."
anr.5.b:0 "Send in the army!"
anr.6.t:0 "Statist Revolt"
anr.6.d:0 "Horrible news has surfaced; a politician from one of the former statist regimes has risen to such influence in a commune that he has declared himself the leader, and seeks to reinstitute statist oppression. This cannot stand, but we must tread carefully against these traitors. We could assemble a large strike force to attack the rebelling statists, although it is technically out of our hands. If we let the local militias handle the traitors, we may end up with a costly battle."
anr.6.a:0 "Let's see them dodge lead."
anr.6.b:0 "Let the militias handle it."
anr.7.t:0 "Military Centralizes Government"
anr.7.d:0 "With the increasing influence of the Black Army over the communal councils, the military has decided to make its powers official. They wish to establish military governance, where officers can influence communal decisions as well as having control over conscription and war production. While this reeks of statism, the increased power of the military may have long term benefits."
anr.7.a:0 "The military knows best!"
anr.7.b:0 "Weed out this statist dissent."
anr.8.t:0 "Communal Failure"
anr.8.d:0 "It appears not everyone is willing to bear the responsibility of living in a classless society. One commune has become rampant with failure, with people refusing to work and frequently getting into massive brawls against each other or local communes. As a result, the commune’s standard of living is awful, and many are dying within it. We could let them wallow in their misery, to show the rest of the communes the consequences of failing to comply, or we could provide relief to try and rebuild the commune, but this will be costly."
anr.8.a:0 "They knew the consequences of their actions."
anr.8.b:0 "Cut them some slack, we help our comrades!"
anr.9.t:0 "Eastern Hostlity"
anr.9.d:0 "Due to the mostly autonomous nature of the Black Army, there have been several incidents of cross border raids. However, a recent incident has occured between the border of the Southern Mandate and one of the military communal bases. A raid was launched into Mississippi and New Orleans, where our men were reported to have acted like “bandits”. The League of Nations bounced back, and launched an attack against our forces. The battle is still raging on, but we could choose to force the officer behind the raid to cease, although this might be terrible for our image."
anr.9.a:0 "To hell with statists!"
anr.9.b:0 "Reel in these militants."
anr.10.t:0 "Church Dispute"
anr.10.d:0 "Religion has always been a controversial subject in anarchist circles. Many view it as a statist ploy to force the common man to become enslaved to a group masquerading as a higher being, while others cite that religious ideals like equality and brotherhood would be a good way to promote our cause. It is now put to the test, as a local commune has tried to force a local Church to collectivize their property to be diverted to the anarchist cause. The Church, as well as religious figures abroad, have criticized this action, and demanded that we honor the sanctity of the Church grounds. Forcing the Church to concede would be the ultimate demonstration of the deconstruction of statism, but it could hurt relations both internal and external. We could give Churches exceptions, but while it will appeal to the mostly Christian populace of our nation, it will weaken the legitimacy of anarchy."
anr.10.a:0 "No Gods, no Masters!"
anr.10.b:0 "Jesus was a carpenter."
anr.11.t:0 "The Question of Power"
anr.11.d:0 "With the successful consolidation of the commune’s control over Texas and subsequent vanquishing of the statists in the lower Mississippi region, it is very clear that the stability that Sacco had remained President to obtain has arrived. However, the real question is now before us, will Sacco fulfill his promise? Power was to be relinquished to local communal authority, so that no man is above another. Anarchy may be self sustainable, but the only reason we have survived was through Sacco and the Black Army’s leadership. We could extend the state of emergency, but this may have unforeseen consequences."
anr.11.a:0 "The people are ready to guide themselves."
anr.11.b:0 "They still need our guidance."
anr.12.t:0 "The Horns of War"
anr.12.d:0 "With the refusal of Sacco to step down, riots have broken out throughout the free territory. Many have condemned him as a traitor, and have decided to denounce any Black Army authority. Seperatist militants have taken over southern Texas, with the goal to “fulfill the promises to the people''. A new type of anarchy has been established along the Mississippi river, swearing loyalty to the ideas of anarcho-syndicalism and a belief that only they can save the people. In the midst of the chaos, statist dogs have established a military dictatorship in the north, with the goal of uniting the South under their rule and the destruction of all “socialists”. The central states were quickly garrisoned and overrun by the Black Army, but we still have enemies surrounding us. Only one thing for certain; the Second Texan Civil War has begun."
anr.12.a:0 "We will redeem anarchy!"
