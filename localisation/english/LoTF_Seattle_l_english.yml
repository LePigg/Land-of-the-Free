 sea.1.t:0 "Slaves No More"
 sea.1.d:0 "After the Democrat-CMP coalition won the 1932 elections, it appeared that the revolution had reached the United States. However, after President Franklin D. Roosevelt was assassinated during his inauguration and the subsequent swearing in of Vice President Norman Thomas, the country plunged into chaos. Many accused the CMP of staging the assasination so they could send America down a path to violent revolution as did the Russians did, and soon mass riots and protests gripped the nation. Faced with no other choice, president Norman Thomas was forced to call for War Plan White to be enacted. However, in this moment of weakness, the military under general MacArthur staged a coup in Washington to end the CMP’s rule. Their failure to secure the entire nation started the 2nd American Civil War. The nation segmented into various nations, pledging loyalty to the Red Movement, Federalist Movement, or none. In the west coast, California under Upton Sinclair affirmed loyalty to Thomas’ government in Chicago, which caused the states in the Cascadian Region to declare a provisional government. The new president of the Cascadian State, Pat McCarran, demanded the submission of all northwestern states to fight the socialist threat. While almost all complied, the state of Washington refused to comply. William Z. Foster, then a member of the CMP, overthrew the governor of Washington to establish a dictatorship of the proletariat, against McCarran’s regime. The Cascadians almost immediately invaded the state, managing to secure the loyalty of Yakima, but soon found themselves in a brutal siege of Seattle. Foster had appealed to the rest of the Red Movement to immediately seek Soviet aid, which was controversial due to Soviet communism being seen as incompatible with the American Dream, but it was becoming increasingly apparent there was no other option. Foster urged his men to take not one step back against Cascadia while Soviet volunteers crossed the pacific. Although Sinclair was later ousted in a coup, his followers began a guerilla war against Cascadia, destroying their supply lines and forcing them to commit resources away from Seattle. The invasion of the East Coast by the League forced the Federal Western Defense Command to lower their garrisons, allowing popular civilian revolt to cripple them. With their enemies collapsing from within, Foster ordered a grand offensive, retaking the rest of the Seattle metro and pushing into Yakima. However, despite his victory, the Red Movement collapsed due to the League capturing the east coast, and the nation collapsed into anarchy. Foster began to view the CMP as weak, determining that their capitalist influence had caused them to lose the war. He soon reestablished the Communist Party USA, and has led Seattle to become the true bastion of American Communism. With Soviet Aid, Foster is fully committed to finishing the Second American Revolution."

 sea.2.t:0 "First Contact"
 sea.2.d:0 "A detachment of Seattle's nationa guard entered the Olympian Mountains Territory with no armed weapons in hands. It took some hesitance, but a representative walked outside their hiding spot. Luckily, they are willing to peacefully negociate. The first issue that arised was if the rebels were to receive clemency."
 sea.2.a:0 "Of course"
 sea.2.b:0 "Rebels are traitors and traitors deserve death!"
 sea.3.t:0 "Negociating Free Speech"
 sea.3.d:0 "Now that we are willing to offer clemency, the rebels also demand that free speech not be regulated by the police and the right to peacefully protest be restored."
 sea.3.a:0 "Fine"
 sea.3.b:0 "We won't be betraying the revolution just for some rebels!"
 sea.4.t:0 "Negociating Democracy"
 sea.4.d:0 "The rebels' final request is that local elections be allowed. This would mean democratically electing mayors and city officials."
 sea.4.a:0 "This could increase our legitimacy"
 sea.4.b:0 "This has gone too far!"
 sea.5.t:0 "Closing the Old Door"
 sea.5.d:0 "The stubborn old guards hiding in Spokane have finally been brought down to their knees. No matter how many times the guards have told them to shut up, the "Acting President" kept yelling of how our revolution will tear down and destroy America. This is completely false as we will not destroy America, but rather restructure it for the people. As the October Revolution has done, the previous government must come to an end, including the people who govern."
 sea.5.a:0 "Off with their head"
 sea.6.t:0 "Tyranny in Disguise"
 sea.6.d:0 "Our government hopes the people understand that the "freedom" that Mencken had once promised is worse for the people. Oppression by the free market was the cause of the Great Depression and the need for Seattle Revolution. New libertarian ideals will not be tolerated and wrongly influene the working class."
 sea.6.a:0 "The State provides freedom for all"
 sea.8.t:0 "The Main Attraction"
 sea.8.d:0 "McCarran woke up from a rough nap, stil blindfolded. He last thing he remembers was his bunker being broken in and being headbutted by the stock of a rifle. He could feel the blood fall out of his nostril and onto his ragged pants. After a few minutes of bumpy driving, the vehicle he sat in came to a complete stop. A door opens and he hears someone scream at him to get out. Cold hands touched his neck and he could feel rope clench at his throat. An audience could be heard screaming and yelling as a loud voice from a speaker listed McCarran's crimes against the Seattle Commune. It was all a daze to him. He was forced to walk up stairs of what seemed to be a gallow. The loud voice then ordered the crowd to be silent and listed the punishment of said crimes. After what seemed to be an hour of ranting, the atmosphere became quiet and McCarran could feel the floor beneath him give in."
 sea.8.a:0 "And the crowd goes wild"
 sea.7.t:0 "Collapsed Communes"
 sea.7.d:0 "While we applaud the WKFL for establishing farming communes and abolishing private property, we cannot deny the brutality and indoctrination were dehumanizing. The nonsense preached about God and divinity filling the people's minds with misguidance. Sadly, most former cultists will have to go through vigorous reintroduction into society."
