#Character Descriptions
MIA_league_nations_desc:0 "The League of Nations Council is the main executive body of the League of Nations, made up of four permanent members and eleven nonpermanent members. In recent years, the Council has come to be dominated by the British and Germans, with the French and Italians having less and less authority. As part of their duties, the Council administrates all League Mandates, until such a time that they are deemed capable of forming their own governments. This is viewed as foreign oppression by many in America, and those who wish for the current system to continue number fewer and fewer every day."
MIA_joseph_kennedy_desc:0 "Joseph Kennedy placed himself as the candidate for reform and restructuring in the Northern Mandate, hoping to realize the dream of the late President Franklin Roosevelt. Championing reform of the bureaucracy and responsible public investment, Kennedy was seen by many as the last hope for liberalism in the US, and his path is marred by many challenges. As the first Roman Catholic President, along with the fact that he is the only U.S. President to never be elected by the people, but instead appointed by a foreign body, many Americans distrust Kennedy, believing him to be a puppet of European interests. Combined with the disastrous state of the American economy, the corruption rife in Washington, and the untrained rabble that make up the Mandate’s army, Kennedy’s work is certainly cut out for him."
MIA_james_wadsworth_desc:0 "Poster child of the New Republican movement, Wadsworth represents a paradigm shift in the Republican party, with the ascension of a third major Republican faction to rival the establishment and the liberal Republicans. Wadsworth and his allies believe that governments become less efficient and less beneficial the farther removed they are from the people that they’re responsible for, and therefore seek to return as much authority to the states as possible. The election of Wadsworth, supporters hope, will signal the beginning of a long era of New Republican dominance in the GOP, rather than the policies of the liberals or pro-business establishment."
MIA_john_winant_desc:0 "The first President to be an official independent since George Washington, John Winant is an anomaly among the 33 men to serve as President of the United States. For one, Winant is the only President not elected by the Electoral College. Not attempting to hide his strong connections to the United Kingdom and the rest of the League of Nations, Winant’s popularity is measured not so much as those who support him vs. those who oppose him, as much as it is those who despise him and those who only tolerate him. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have decried Winant as a puppet of foreign interests, and are stonewalling most of his legislation in Congress, with only his few Independent allies championing his cause."
MIA_david_stirling_desc:0 "When the League of Nations appointed a President, the unsaid expectation was that the Northern Mandate would continue to support the British and their allies whenever it was deemed necessary. But when the President defied the British request for American manpower to supplement their own armies fighting to preserve freedom in Europe, this insult could not be ignored. And so David Stirling, Supreme Commander of the International Armies in North America, was tasked by the League of Nations Council with removing the insolent President and creating a more involved League administration, one that would provide the British with all that they required."
MIA_george_marshall_desc:0 "After “Prime Minister” John Winant tried to send American sons to die in a foreign war that does not concern American interests whatsoever, Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall was forced to intervene. Leading a contingent of troops loyal to the old order, Marshall marched on the White House, detained Winant and his ministers, and proclaimed a period of “temporary military rule until foreign interests can be purged from the American government”. While most Americans supported this action to remove Winant, popularly viewed as a British puppet, there are many who are concerned that Marshall is just another MacArthurite, though Marshall insists that unlike MacArthur, his junta is intended to be only temporary."

mia.1.t:0 "The Northern Star"
mia.1.d:0 "The League of Nations, mainly European countries, was created by the great powers to ensure that the mistakes of the Great War never happen again and that the Concert of Europe is maintained. While originally meant for all members to have equal power, the British have managed to take most power with Germany trailing behind; the French and Italians only attend resolutions for symbolic gestures. As time progressed, the international government organisation became a staunch anti-communist bloc after the explusion of the Soviet Union for their military support for Thomas that he deserpately requested for. As the Second American Civil War caught international attention, the League of Nations was called up to the task of intervening on behalf of General MacArthur. As the war continued to rage on, MacArthur betrayed the League of Nations, claiming the League had betrayed him for occupying port cities. Inevitably, both the Thomas Administration and MacArthur’s clique fell to our overwhelming firepower and coordination. As the war dragged on, the international community became less ecstatic moving deeper into the country. After pushing all the way up to the Ohio River, the Northern and Southern Mandates were born. The Northern Mandate is the model League of Nations mandate with the least resistance from the locals and a restoration of democracy. As the years of occupation continue, New Englanders are beginning to demand a sense of normalcy similar to the beginning of the century. With mounting internal pressure for reform and external pressure from both the League of Nations and warlords on the border, time will tell if the Northern Mandate will survive."

The opposition warn that the Atlantic Fleet will only simply ignore the request and will continue to target civilian ships. The second plan devised by war hawks call for the immediate liberation of Puerto Rico with a naval invasion. This plan may be difficult due to the Atlantic Fleet's large naval presence in the carribean. The final solution presented is to fund Puerto Rican nationalists to overthrow the Federalist government.

The moderate democratic coalition consisting of the Partido Unión Republicana and the Partido Obrero Socialista which would rather see Puerto Rican independence through peaceful means, but are receptive to our funding. The other option are the violently ultranationst Partido Nacionalista de Puerto Rico who is notorious for conducting assassinations and terrorism in order to bring attention to their cause. While the PNPR always hated the United States government, they are not keen on working with our government once they gain independence; however, the PNPR are the most likely to suceed at toppling the Federalist presence. Seeing as the democratic coalition is currently complying with Nimitz and his fleet, many in the International Congress believe they will be less likely to suceed or even outright rebel.

Once again, we are presented with two options. The first plan devised by war hawks call for the immediate liberation of Puerto Rico with a naval invasion.

In his place, Ralph Chaplin has called for all Appalachian labor workers to rise in solidarity against the Northern Mandate's "terrible laws." Over the course of the week, several rural cities in the SouthWest have annouced support for the Miners' cause. So far, we have only lost control of the Cumberland Gap region, but it is expected that their area of control will only grow larger. As a result of this crisis, the local economy has grinded to a hault due to the lack of coal."

mia.12.d:0 "The West Virginia miners’ strike has massively expanded in recent days, with many mines having to close down due to an inability to find enough miners to operate. While the earlier strikes caused a noticeable increase in the price of coal, this now thousands-strong strike represents the potential to cripple the Northern Mandate’s economy and erode the legitimacy of the League-backed government in D.C."

As Presidential elections have been temporarily suspended by the International Congress until the Mandates are deemed capable of conducting legitimate elections, the task of electing a new President for the Northern Mandate has fallen to them. Journalists are reporting that the International Congress has essentially narrowed down their list of potential Presidents from more than twenty to just 3. The first candidate, favored by more liberal members of the IC, is Massachusetts businessman Joseph Kennedy. Kennedy has pledged to reinvigorate the Northern Mandate’s economy via responsible public work initiatives, as well as increased regulation of the financial sector to ensure another Great Depression cannot happen. On the other hand, New York Senator James W. Wadsworth has become the darling of the conservative faction, representing a new vision for the American government, one that involves significantly less involvement in the affairs of individuals and states. Wadsworth has promised to “trim the fat” of the Federal government, in order to cut government spending and therefore cut taxes. Lastly, a small minority of hardliners and imperialists have put forth former New Hampshire Governor John Winant. Winant has been criticized for his support of further integration into the League of Nations, and closer cooperation with the British and French.

The mine owners are incredulous at this demand, arguing that an 8 hour workday might as well mean the mines permanently staying closed, since they claim that next to no work would get done in that time. The miners, however, argue that a shorter workday would allow for more time for recreation and rest, thus making them happier and therefore less likely to strike."

Historically, most industries have given workers Sunday off so that they can go to church, and many have even give workers half-days on Saturdays, but mining still requires workers to mine on Saturdays. The miners insist that they be given all of Saturday and Sunday off, in order to allow them to take care of their families and attend to other business, while mine leaders are apoplectic at the shortening of the work week even further."

Though the Department of Labor has seen a large portion of its low-level staff vanish overnight, the reaction of the American public has so far been overwhelmingly positive. It seems that most Americans are of the same mind of the President, that is, that the Socialists are half responsible for the collapse, and thus must be kept as far from positions of authority as possible. While many fired servicemen protested that they are kept from defending their country because of their political beliefs, the people of America and their former coworkers in the military are largely unsympathetic. As a result, the exiled President Norman Thomas has offered jobs to all of these socialist servicemen in Chicago."

The only similarity between these new retirees is that they all seemingly expressed sympathies for the rebel General Douglas MacArthur. Several sources within the Executive Branch have stated that these “retirements” are mere facades for President Kennedy’s continued purging of the military, this time of MacArthurites. President Kennedy did recently give a speech decrying “the twin snakes of Socialism and MacArthurism” for destroying the United States, so this reasoning would not be out of the question. General MacArthur has reportedly decried this act of “political pettiness” and offered to commission any Mandate officer who fled to his domain in Ohio."

With the House of Representatives now just a memory, and our relationship with London closer than it has been since before the Revolutionary War, to say PM Winant is a controversial man would be a gross understatement. The mere fact that he is now Prime Minister Winant and not President Winant is disgraceful enough to many, but his many other actions have been called “treasonous” and “submissive” by his many critics. Regardless, however, the large amount of foreign investment he has brought in has undoubtedly helped to alleviate some of the Depression."

In the latest example of this, Italian Ambassador Fulvio Suvich has issued a call for 5,000 Italian-Americans to enlist to fight for their ancestral homeland.

This has also coincided with a rise in immigrant Americans becoming community agitators either in favor or in opposition to enlistment in their homeland’s army. This has been most notable in the Irish-American communities of New York and Boston, where British recruitment drives have indeed led to a mass enlistment of Irish-Americans to fight in Europe– on the side of the French."

German recruiters have begun traveling across the small towns of rural Pennsylvania, visiting the various settlements that still speak German as their first language.

The tone of the letter makes it clear that we have no choice in the matter, and that the only alternative to furnishing the recruits they’ve demanded is war, which we absolutely cannot afford. We can look for ways to package this to the public as a moral duty to defend democracy and liberty, but that will only help with damage control, and most of the public won’t believe it.

MIA_kennedy_create_sec_desc:0 "The Great Depression caused in large part by irresponsible investing by large stockholders, the vast majority of whom made it through the Depression with their fortunes intact. President Kennedy knows this well, as he himself was a massive stockholder. To ensure that this kind of irresponsible investing never again destroys the country, he has created the SEC to oversee all stock market activity."
MIA_kennedy_end_reds:0 "Purge Socialists"
MIA_kennedy_end_reds_desc:0 "While the vast majority of socialist officers and enlisted personnel fled West to Chicago after the collapse, some stayed in our military and are continuing to spread their traitorous propaganda to this day. These agitators must be rooted out and fired, or arrested if possible."
MIA_kennedy_end_war_profit:0 "End War Profiteering "
MIA_kennedy_end_war_profit_desc:0 "Ever since the collapse, a select few unscrupulous individuals have made fortunes selling weapons to whichever rebel faction wants to buy them, regardless of their own opinions of that government. These weapons are then used to kill other Americans and to oppose the return of democracy and the rightful American government. This must be stopped at once."
MIA_kennedy_end_feds:0 "Retire Federalists"
MIA_kennedy_end_feds_desc:0 "MacArthur’s Federalists are at least as culpable in the collapse of America as the Socialists are, but they do not have the same public notoriety around them that the Reds do. Thus, we cannot simply arrest or fire those officers in our military who are sympathetic to MacArthur’s junta, but we can encourage them to seek other employment opportunities."
MIA_kennedy_end_the_mob:0 "Crackdown on the Mob"
MIA_kennedy_end_the_mob_desc:0 "Organized Crime has been a problem in America as long as America has existed. But with the onset of Prohibition, the Stock Market Crash, and the collapse, the Mafia in the Northern Mandate has only grown stronger and stronger. It’s gotten to the point where the Mafia is able to assassinate public officials in broad daylight with no one ever being brought to trial for it."
MIA_kennedy_end_corruption:0 "End Corruption"
MIA_kennedy_end_corruption_desc:0 "Corruption has penetrated every level of the Northern Mandate, from city councilmen and county commissioners all the way to the Senate. President Kennedy has vowed to make sure this corruption is stopped during his Presidency, and though he has a long road ahead of him, many are hopeful that he will be able to make good on his promise."
MIA_kennedy_end_focus:0 "A Fairer America"
MIA_kennedy_end_focus_desc:0 "The horrors of the Depression will not soon be forgotten, nor will America be restored overnight, but at last it seems as though Kenendy and the Democrats have brought America out of its decay and put it on the path to greatness once more."
MIA_wadsworth_presidency:0 "The Wadsworth Presidency"
MIA_wadsworth_presidency_desc:0 "New York Senator James W. Wadsworth and his New Republicans have taken the reigns of the Northern Mandate. Wadsworth promises to decrease the size of the federal government, give tax cuts to Americans, and devolve power back to the states."
MIA_wadsworth_big_business:0 "Work with Big Business"
MIA_wadsworth_big_business_desc:0 "Big business has always been a central part of the American experience. President Wadsworth believes that the needless antagonization of corporations by Presidents Roosevelt and Thomas in no small part led to the collapse. Therefore, President Wadsworth has given tax cuts to the highest earning individuals and companies, in a belief that they will use these savings to create jobs and invest in their communities."
MIA_wadsworth_tax_breaks:0 "Tax Breaks"
MIA_wadsworth_tax_breaks_desc:0 "Despite the advancements made on tax reform so far, the average American still pays far too much income tax to the Federal government. While President Wadsworth has expressed support for an amendment repealing the 16th, for the time being he has simply elected to return up to 40% of income tax collected to the taxpayer."
MIA_wadsworth_trustinmarket:0 "Restore Trust in the Markets"
MIA_wadsworth_trustinmarket_desc:0 "The connection between Black Thursday and the collapse is one that anyone can easily make. In order to prevent another collapse, it is absolutely critical that the American people learn to trust the markets once again, and President Wadsworth aims to lead by example, by publicly investing a large sum of his personal wealth into stocks."
MIA_wadsworth_churches:0 "Partner with Churches"
MIA_wadsworth_churches_desc:0 "President Wadsworth is a deeply religious man, and he believes that the greatest provider of welfare services in the United States should be the various churches and religious institutions in the country, rather than the government. Therefore, the Wadsworth administration has partnered with many Christian organizations to give them tax breaks in exchange for providing community services."
MIA_wadsworth_selfresponsibility:0 "Encourage Personal Responsibility"
MIA_wadsworth_selfresponsibility_desc:0 "Though the vast majority of Americans are not responsible for their current destitution, the collapse and Depression not being of their own making, they cannot rely on the government to make everything right once more. We must encourage Americans to take responsibility for themselves, and to better their own economic situations."
MIA_wadsworth_slim_bureaucracy:0 "Slim the bureaucracy"
MIA_wadsworth_slim_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The American bureaucracy is infamous for its byzantine and redundant systems. By far the largest money pit in the American government, President Wadsworth has made it his mission to gut the bureaucracy of all unnecessary personnel and departments in order to lessen the Federal budget."
MIA_wadsworth_slim_bureaucracy1:0 "Disband the Labor Department"
MIA_wadsworth_slim_bureaucracy1_desc:0 "One of the larger cabinet-level departments, the Department of Labor is extremely expensive relative to its size. Add to this the fact that it is rife with socialists, communists, CMP-backers, and all manner of left populists, and President Wadsworth believes it is wholly unnecessary."
MIA_wadsworth_slim_bureaucracy2:0 "Slash the FBI Budget"
MIA_wadsworth_slim_bureaucracy2_desc:0 "The Federal Bureau of Investigation saw some success during the 1920s in the hunt of various gangsters in the South and Midwest, but since then it has largely been a massive expenditure with little to no benefit. President Wadsworth believes that the FBI often does more harm than good, and so has proposed a massive cut to the Bureau’s budget."
MIA_wadsworth_slim_bureaucracy3:0 "End Federal Interference in State Affairs"
MIA_wadsworth_slim_bureaucracy3_desc:0 "The key difference between the Republican Party’s Old Guard and the New Republicans led by President Wadsworth is the issue of state’s rights. On this topic, the New Republicans more closely resemble Dixiecrats than they do their fellow Republicans, believing that almost every issue should be handled in Albany, Harrisburg, Annapolis, and so on, rather than in Washington."
MIA_wadsworth_tariff:0 "Tariff Reform"
MIA_wadsworth_tariff_desc:0 "As part of his program to make the government less involved in the life and pocketbook of the average American, President Wadsworth has urged the Republican-majority Congress to repeal almost all tariffs, to allow for a system of total free trade in the Northern Mandate."
MIA_wadsworth_fre:0 "A Free America"
MIA_wadsworth_fre_desc:0 " At long last, America finally resembles the vision the Founders had for it 160 years ago. The Northern Mandate has done what the United States could not, and has become a confederation of states, rather than a top-down government led by D.C."
MIA_wadsworth_independence:0 "Build Independence from London"
MIA_wadsworth_independence_desc:0 "Though it was largely thanks to lobbying by British diplomats that Wadsworth was appointed President in the first place, President Wadsworth knows that the American people will never accept him as a legitimate President if they view him as British puppet. Therefore, he is committed to gradually supporting the independence of the Northern Mandate."
MIA_winant_presidency:0 "The Winant Presidency"
MIA_winant_presidency_desc:0 "Former New Hampshire Governor John Winant is now President, and the first independent to hold the office since George Washington. Entering office as one of the least popular Presidents in American history, Winant has a long road ahead of him to save America."
MIA_winant_bp:0 "British Petroleum in Pennsylvania"
MIA_winant_bp_desc:0 "After the collapse, a lot of America’s oil companies were scattered across warlords and rebel governments, and those that remained in our territory have lost the vast majority of their infrastructure. British oil giant BP is in a much better situation for extraction."
MIA_winant_tax_privileges:0 "Tax Privileges for Foreigners"
MIA_winant_tax_privileges_desc:0 "The Great Depression hit us far harder than it hit the rest of the world, and many countries are already well on the road to recovery. Therefore it would be foolish not to encourage foreign wealth to be spent here in America, rather than their own nations."
MIA_winant_purchase_cruiser:0 "Buy British Ships"
MIA_winant_purchase_cruiser_desc:0 "Our navy is a shell of its former self, with the Pacific Fleet entirely out of our control and most of the Atlantic Fleet resorting to piracy, and building a fleet takes time. Therefore, we look to our friends in London to sell us some older ships to supplement our forces."
MIA_winant_france_investment:0 "French Investment"
MIA_winant_france_investment_desc:0 "Although the British and French are not on the best terms, that doesn’t mean we can’t take their money, too. When you think about it, every Franc that goes to us is a Franc that doesn’t fund their military..."
MIA_winant_canada:0 "Customs Union with Canada"
MIA_winant_canada_desc:0 "Our closest ally, both in physical proximity and relationship, is the Dominion of Canada. To strengthen both our nations, we should remove all trade barriers between us."
MIA_winant_moneymoneymoney:0 "Officialize the Pound and Franc"
MIA_winant_moneymoneymoney_desc:0 "So many of our wealthiest citizens are now foreign expats, the bulk of whom have wealth still in the form of British Pounds and French Francs. Therefore, we should make these two official currencies alongside the Dollar."
MIA_winant_internationalism:0 "Commit to Internationalism"
MIA_winant_internationalism_desc:0 "If we want the world to take us seriously as the legitimate successor to the United States, we have to involve ourselves more on the world stage."
MIA_winant_red_cross:0 "Support the Red Cross"
MIA_winant_red_cross_desc:0 "One of the greatest examples of international cooperation is the International Red Cross. Supporting them will win us points with foreign governments, and is so uncontroversial it can’t make anyone mad at us."
MIA_winant_bootlick_briish:0 "Appoint British Delegates to Cabinet"
MIA_winant_bootlick_briish_desc:0 "If we are to restore America, we must do it fighting alongside the British, not against them. The first step in increasing cooperation between our two great nations is appointing British officials to our cabinet, so that they know what is going on within our apparatus."
MIA_winant_prime_minister:0 "Reforming the Presidency"
MIA_winant_prime_minister_desc:0 "The way that the Presidency works is one of the reasons that the collapse happened. Therefore, President Winant has announced his support for a reorganization of the Presidency, making it more accountable to Congress and less to the people."
MIA_winant_parliament_desc:0 "The Constitution failed America, and so we should disregard it. The Westminster system is far more stable, and we should instead replicate it, with a Prime Minister elected by the House of Representatives."
MIA_winant_parliament:0 "Reform Congress into Parliament"
MIA_winant_bootlick_briish2:0 "Request British Garrison"
MIA_winant_bootlick_briish2_desc:0 "People are not exactly happy with our reforms, and the threat of warlord conflict grows ever closer. Therefore, we need a permanent detachment of British troops to support our small army."
MIA_winant_briish_access:0 "Allow British Troops"
MIA_winant_briish_access_desc:0 "We need to massively expand the British Garrison and give them more control over our military structure to ensure stability."
MIA_winant_new_america:0 "A New America"
MIA_winant_new_america_desc:0 "America has been reborn, thanks to John Winant. Though some refuse to accept our progress, we have made America anew and it will never collapse again."
