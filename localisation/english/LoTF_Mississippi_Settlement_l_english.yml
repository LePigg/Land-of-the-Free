mss.1.t:0 "By Ourselves"
mss.1.d:0 "The history of Africans in the New World is one of hardship. The memories of slavery still sting, while the evils of segregation and racism live on. To many, the promises of “liberty and justice for all” were hollow. However, it seemed that this injustice would soon be at an end to the African-American community. The Common Man’s party promised to dismantle the corrupt aspects of American society, racism being one of them. Many African Americans were converted to the socialist cause, with the Solidarity Movement led by Asa Randolph being integrated into the CMP. However, the dream faltered when the Federalist Movement arrived. The ensuing civil war between the Federalists and the Socialists knocked all anti racist progress back to square one. Many white supremacist groups such as the Silver Legion and KKK rose up against the CMP, and crimes against the black community skyrocketed. The KKK had managed to take over Vicksburg and were using it as a base of operations to terrorize the black community. William Du Bois was sickened by this, and decided to rally African - Americans who had been conscripted into the CMP’s army to kick the klan out of the city. After fierce fighting, the Klan were forced to retreat into Alabama. Du Bois knew that the nation would collapse, and he needed a way to keep the civilians safe. He decided to create an independent republic on the ashes of the former klan base to be a safe haven for all during the war. The Mississippi Settlements as it came to be known became a shining democracy with liberty for all under Du Bois. However, once the dust of war had settled, many misplaced African Americans fled to the new republic, and the threat of radicalism may uproot it’s foundations of liberty."
mss.1.a:0 "What a mess"
mss.2.t:0 "Civil Rights"
mss.2.d:0 "The Question of this Town Hall Debate is how civil rights should play a role in government. Many believe that it is only just that everyone receives the equal protection and rights under the law while some believe that previously oppressed ethnicities should receive "temporary" civil right protections. Lastly, a group of reformers suggest that the status quo should be enforced as it works perfectly fine."
mss.2.a:0 "Equal protections for all"
mss.2.b:0 "The status quo is the way to go"
mss.2.c:0 "Some will be more protected than others"
mss.3.t:0 "Minimum Livings"
mss.3.d:0 "A radical idea has been proposed today in the Town Hall Debate: a minimum living. Many in the court argued whether a minimum living is a minimum wage or government housing. The major issue is who should be in charge of what will be the minimum living."
mss.3.a:0 "The government knows best"
mss.3.b:0 "Businesses know better"
mss.3.c:0 "A minimum wage is all that is needed."
mss.4.t:0 "The Other Ethnicities"
mss.4.d:0 "Now that a solution has been found for the future of white people in this republic, the question of the rest of the population remains. Do they deserve the same treatment or is there a better solution?"
mss.4.a:0 "They are part of the one struggle"
mss.4.b:0 "All are equal below the law"
mss.4.c:0 "The status quo already set precedence"
mss.4.e:0 "We must help our people first"
mss.5.t:0 "The Fate of Local Companies"
mss.5.d:0 "Many companies and businesses have fled from our land fearing a violent overtake of all daily life. In reality, we are simply a democratic republic that rose from the ashes of another. The remaining businesses refuse to cooperate with our government, citing that we are illegitimate. The Town Hall Debate has formed two opposing factions: either the government should put on the velvet gloves or an iron fist to finally have their cooperation."
mss.5.a:0 "An iron fist is needed to prevent discord"
mss.5.b:0 "You can't have cooperation with threats"
mss.6.t:0 "Trust Busting"
mss.6.d:0 "Remnants of trust corporations still exists in our borders. They range from the sister companies of the late Standard Oil Company to the monopolies of Ford and General Motors. The question of this Town Hall Debate is what to do with these companies. Should we continue tolerating their existence or should something be done about them?"
mss.6.a:0 "Monopolies must be destroyed to free the people"
mss.6.b:0 "We could use their help later on"
mss.7.t:0 "The Election of 1936"
mss.7.d:0 "After a year of preparation and intense speeches from all parties of this democracy, the next four years' fate will depend on this day. After several hours of counting and recounting ballots, the close election was won by..."
mss.7.a:0 "the Solidarity Party!"
mss.7.b:0 "the NAACP Coalition!"
mss.7.c:0 "the Broader Movement!"
mss.7.e:0 "the New Afrika Party!"
mss.8.t:0 "Extending the Olive Branch"
mss.8.d:0 "The Republic of West Mississippi has sent us a proposal that we unite our two nations and minorities in a white dominated America. They offer equal rights and a democratic foundation. Should we trust them or are we better off alone?"
mss.8.a:0 "We don't have any better options"
mss.8.b:0 "We don't need or trust those fools!"
mss.9.t:0 "Sequoyah Accepts!"
mss.9.d:0 "Sequoyah has decided it is better that we become one nation rather than fight one another."
mss.9.a:0 "Welcome!"
mss.10.t:0 "Sequoyah Declines!"
mss.10.d:0 "Sequoyah would rather be stomped and destroyed by the Silver Legion than join forces with us. It is in our best interest to take over Oklahoma before the white fascists take it over."
mss.10.a:0 "Why does it have to be this way?"
mss.11.t:0 "Meeting with Orlando Ward"
mss.11.d:0 "The West Mississippi Republic has offered that our army joins them in defence of the people. Though can we really trust these people?"
mss.11.a:0 "Our main purpose is to protect the people. This is the way."
mss.11.b:0 "The army always knows best! This new republic can't be trusted!"
mss.12.t:0 "General Ward Accepts!"
mss.12.d:0 "General Ward has agreed to our terms. His army and generals will now join our forces and move as one."
mss.12.a:0 "Great!"
mss.13.t:0 "General Ward Declines!"
mss.13.d:0 "General Ward has refused any cooperation with us and he believes that our way of democracy is similar to that of what led to the demise of the United States. It is in our best interest to secure their land before anyone else gets it. Time for war."
mss.13.a:0 "A needless war"
mss.14.t:0 "Coup D'etat"
mss.14.d:0 "A group of mercenaries hired from East Oklahoma have arrived in Muskogee to proclaim the People's Republic of Sequoyah. The government was too weak to even resist the coup. For now, the new communist government is being set up."
mss.14.a:0 "It was a shitty government anyways"
mss.15.t:0 "Annexation"
mss.15.d:0 "Our collaborators in Sequoyah have completed a rigged vote for their country to join ours. The reported turnout vote was 99% with a 98% yes for annexation though we may never know the real results. It doesn't matter now. Let us welcome our brothers in arms."
mss.15.a:0 "As planned"
MSS_fascism_party:0 "New Afrika Movement"
