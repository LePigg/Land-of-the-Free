tcw.1.t:0 "The Scramble for Texas"
 tcw.1.d:0 "Ever since the Collapse, nobody knew what was happening in Texas. All communication was cut with the rest of America and any attempt to recapture ended with the expedition mysteriously vanishing. Natural disasters ranging from frequent tornados and hurricanes ravaged the state. All assumed that Texas was occupied by anarchy from tens if not hundreds of warlords trying to take over the vital state. The dust has finally settled with only a handful of groups still grabbing for power. In the plains of the texan panhandle are the anarchists who wish to create a free texas without any government. Senator Tom Connally arrived from the Erie Republic after hearing of a chance to restore democracy in the anarchy-riddled land. Many supporters of the old government flocked to his side. Father Coughlin also took advantage of the chaos in Texas. During the time staying the Texas, he has created a religious ferver in Houston to urge americans to help him create a deeply religious christian society and to purge the old ways of rule. Many old democrats were highly outraged by the complete supression of their way of life by the Internationals. The only state truly from the south that were free of influence was Texas. Senator Bilbo entered Austin with other old democrats to create a new republic, a "free" republic. In response to the violence unforlding in the north, many of the Southern Tejanos felt threatened. A deal was struck with Mexico; they would help the navy clear Corpus Christi in exchange for technology sharing and mutual assistance.

tex.1.d:0 "Ever since the civil war, it had been completely quiet in Texas. As it became a battleground for all the factions, ultimately no one could secure the state, leaving it in ruins. However, the destiny of Texas is not one to be silenced, and soon this disorder will come to an end. In the shadows, many of the warring factions plotted to restore order to Texas, and these plots has come to light. The remnants of the Texan Federalists, who deserted from the Southern Army during the civil war due to the suppression of civil rights by the Southern Regime, have declared the restoration of the Texan Republic. Tom Connaly had been elected governor of Texas, hoping that this fell swoop would secure the state, but he was wrong. Rebel factions took their chance to seize control of large swathes of land, including the Acadianian Revolution securing Louisiana, forming a new proto-nation. In response, Connaly has convened with Texas Federalist leader Lucian Truscott to secure the region of Dallas, and to begin Federal mobilization. It seems war is inevitable, and the destiny of Texas will soon be revealed."

Declaring a crusade against Socialism, Coughlin’s fanatical army now stands alongside him, ready to strike the “heretics”. In response to the chaos in Texas, the Mexican government has established border patrols on the Rio Grande, and soon pressured the city of San Antonio to accept their “protection”. The new state of Matagorda, to which many see as a Mexican collaborator regime, has already seized Southern Texas. The battle has only just begun."

Meanwhile in Lubbock, it appears the people there have no intention of ending the Texan anarchy. Rallied under Niccola Sacco, he has declared himself the temporary leader of the anarchist revolution, seeking to establish a communal society in Texas.

This, combined with all the other disloyalty we’re dealing with, has combined to make people more distrusting and unsupportive of our government than ever before.

tma.4.d:0 "In Frank Hamer’s latest bid for support among the settlers of the plains and rural country, he’s given a speech in Valentine, Texas praising the rugged individualism of the “Old West’ era of half a century ago, promising that under the Rangers, Texas will return to this style of limited government and prosperity for all. Though seeing limited success among the more populated areas of the state, this message has seen resounding support among the farmers and miners of West Texas, who have long chafed under the rule of General Walker’s administration and the state government before them. Though nominally a part of our massive governing coalition, the Rangers are clearly gearing up for a seizure of power of their own, though we are unable to stop them without causing a major catastrophe."
tma.4.a:0 "Goddamnit Hamer!"
tma.5.t:0 "Democrats Riot in Austin"
tma.5.d:0 "Today the Democratic Party held a rally in the capitol, calling for the resignation of General Walker and the return of free and fair elections. Congressman Sam Rayburn gave a stirring speech about the need for “the people of Texas to decide the future of their state, not some thick-headed soldier”, which was lauded by all in attendance. As the rally went on, local activist Lyndon Johnson took the stage and his speech quickly turned inflammatory, capitalizing on the crowd’s anger at the military administration, and eventually leading most of the crowd on a march through downtown, with the end goal being the State Capitol building. As they proceeded down Main Street, Johnson called out to those in the shops and restaurants and asked them to join in the march to the Capitol Building. However, not all were sympathetic to his ideals, and the marchers were met with jeers. When they arrived at the Capitol, the police rushed the crowd, arresting many and beating those who resisted, including Johnson. Rayburn, who escaped from the police, gave a speech over the radio decrying that General Walker is willing to use violence against his own people, which has turned even more against Walker."
tma.5.a:0 "They should’ve stopped resisting."
tma.6.t:0 "Coughlinites Intimidate Texans Across State"
tma.6.d:0 "The Radio Priest Charles Coughlin was hugely popular even before the collapse, and his following has only grown in the months since. Since the establishment of the Texan Military Administration, his followers have grown more and more militant and less accepting of those who don’t follow Father Coughlin. In the latest example of this, police reports from Bee Cave, Texas, a small town outside Austin, indicates that a fight broke out between a group of Coughlin supporters and the pedestrians they attempted to convince into listening to the Father’s radio broadcast. Details indicate that the pedestrians refused, and the Coughlinites responded by beating them and escaping before police could stop them. Unfortunately, it seems that their broader goal was successful, with Coughlin’s numbers reaching an all-time high with his latest broadcast."
tma.6.a:0 "He never heard of the Good Samaritan?"
tma.7.t:0 "Democratic Rally Gains Converts"
tma.7.d:0 "In Mesquite, Texas, a suburb of Dallas, Democrats held a massive rally, headlined by former Governor Miriam Ferguson and Congressman Sam Rayburn, with many local politicians and activists from the Dallas-Fort Worth area giving speeches as well. In contrast to the rally in Austin earlier this year, this did not turn violent, in part due to the heavy police presence in the vicinity of the rally, with Mayor B.F. Galloway only allowing the rally to happen out of fear that a refusal would lead to chaos like that seen in Austin. Despite General Walker giving a radio speech at the same time (in an attempt to shrink the Democrats’ crowd), thousands showed up to hear what they had to say, much to the fury of local Walker-aligned administrators."
tma.7.a:0 "Can’t they just leave well enough alone?"
tma.8.t:0 "Coughlinites Take Over Town!"
tma.8.d:0 "In protest of General Walker’s recent actions, Father Charles Coughlin led a protest march through the streets of Wichita Falls, Texas, today. Though the march began with just Coughlin and a small number of acolytes, as they continued through the small town, more and more townsfolk joined them, expressing anger and frustration with the continued Martial Law under General Walker. By the time they reached city hall, the crowd of marchers had grown to several hundred strong, with Father Coughlin front and center. A number of the marchers split off from the main group to head towards the Wichita Falls Sheriff’s Office, presumably under the orders of Coughlin. Seeing that they were vastly outnumbered, the local administrators and sheriff’s deputies fled the town, fearing for their lives. While some low-level bureaucrats and about a half-dozen deputies joined the marchers, the vast majority joined the exodus towards the nearest military outpost. Though military intervention is a near-certainty, in the interim Coughlin and his acolytes have taken over the town, and begun governing it according to his Social Justice philosophy."
tma.8.a:0 "This is not good."
tma.9.t:0 "Walker Enforces Segregation"
tma.9.d:0 "After a meeting with former Mississippi Senator Theodore Bilbo, General Walker has announced that he will use military force to enforce segregation in Texas’s largest cities, if necessary. This comes after reports of the public transit system in the Dallas-Fort Worth area being de-facto unsegregated, something that enraged Bilbo’s Dixiecrats. Of the proclamation, Bilbo said “This is proof that our great military is still watching out for the best interest of God-fearing, White Americans, even after the collapse.” While some liberal Democrats had hoped that the desegregation of Dallas busing (in practice if not in law) would be the thin end of the wedge of total racial equality, General Walker’s own segregationist beliefs made this unlikely."
tma.9.a:0 "I don’t know what they expected."
tma.10.t:0 "REPORT: Dixiecrat-backed Company Towns"
tma.10.d:0 "Mr. Secretary,\n\nAs you know, I was tasked with surveying the area around Fluvanna, as part of the General’s mass land surveying program. As part of my preliminary research, I knew that the area was a strong base of support for the Dixiecrats, but the true extent of their influence was mind-boggling. When I arrived in Fluvanna, the Texaco company name was everywhere: store fronts, gas pumps, even above the door on the Church. I had never seen anything like it, so I spoke with Mayor Alfie Brown (also a middle manager for Texaco), who told me that General Walker had given the entire area over to the Dixiecrats for administration, who brought in Texaco to handle the day-to-day. The Dixiecrats come by to collect taxes and ballots, but leave the minutia to the company men. Now, look, Mr. Secretary, I know we aren’t in the strongest position, but I worry if letting Bilbo and Texaco control people’s lives isn’t gonna do more harm than good."
tma.10.a:0 "Signed, Solomon McCormick."
tma.11.t:0 "Albuquerque Raises Prices"
tma.11.d:0 "General, \n\nDue to some shortages in our arms supply, we have been forced to rely on purchasing small arms from the dealers working out of Albuquerque to supplement our small native arms manufacturing industry. In our latest arms deal, however, the Albuquerque representative informed the Major in charge of the depot that prices had risen– over 300%. Although we do not have the cash to pay these new prices, not arming our troops is even less of an option, so we’ve been forced to shortchange some other areas of spending, but even that is not sustainable. It is entirely possible that we may have to take out lines of credit in order to arm our troops."
tma.11.a:0 "Shit."
tma.12.t:0 "REPORT: Checkpoint Disruptions Successful"
tma.12.d:0 "As part of Operation Alamo, our operatives disrupted the operation of TMA checkpoints in the Galveston and Houston areas utilizing explosives. None of our operatives were apprehended by TMA authorities, and only one was injured, though their life is not in danger. On the contrary, their individual after action reports indicate that some of these checkpoints suffered damage so extensive that it will take weeks to repair, in addition to the death of dozens of TMA fascists who are becoming increasingly hard for Walker to replace."
tma.12.a:0 "Burn in hell, Walker."
tma.13.t:0 "Democrats Gaining Influence!"
tma.13.d:0 "Every day, more and more of our people are attending Democratic Party rallies and calling for a return to civilian rule, calling us “tyrants” and our application of martial law “unconstitutional” and “unnecessary”. Even some members of our government, mostly low-level administrators (thank God), have fallen for the allure of liberal democracy. It’s clear that if we don’t act soon, the effects on our administrative capabilities will be disastrous."
tma.13.a:0 "Damn liberals."
tma.14.t:0 "CMP Winning Converts!"
tma.14.d:0 "It seems that even the Yellow Rose of Texas is not immune to the siren song of socialism. The Texan branch of the Common Man’s Party has seen its numbers swell in the last few weeks, both among urban workers and rural farmers. This failed ideology is completely antithetical to our way of life, and every minute that we don’t root it out is a minute closer to our destruction."
tma.14.a:0 "We should've killed 'em back in '32."
tma.15.t:0 "Coughlin Gaining Followers!"
tma.15.d:0 "Controversial Priest Father Charles Coughlin has seen an explosion in the listeners to his weekly radio program in the last few weeks. His calls for a creation of a new Texas, where Church and State are “one and the same, as God always intended.” Though his basic principles are not terrible to many of our leaders, his insistence on the destruction of the TMA takes it a step too far, and this level of support for an insurrectionist-in-waiting is concerning."
tma.15.a:0 "Lead us not into temptation."
tma.16.t:0 "Ranger Popularity Growing!"
tma.16.d:0 "Frank Hamer’s movement to restore 19th-century governance to Texas is becoming concerningly popular. Drawn to his claims that only the Rangers can restore the “good old days” and create the kind of society that the founders intended. The nature of this kind of philosophy involves a lack of respect for the government, so it goes without saying that this is not good."
tma.16.a:0 "Like they could do better."
tma.17.t:0 "Garand's Profiteering"
tma.17.d:0 "Arms designer John Garand has taken advantage of the collapse and used it to make himself thousands of dollars at the expense of America. First he was selling his goods only to private citizens (and the occasional unsavory individual), but increasingly we have had to purchase his stock as well. The fact that our soldiers, the Rangers, and just about every militia are forced to either use decades-old rifles or buy from him has made him not only incredibly wealthy but very influential as well. His security forces operate essentially independently across our territories in the former state of New Mexico."
tma.17.a:0 "What's he gonna do, attack us?"
tma.18.t:0 "Bilbo's Support Growing"
tma.18.d:0 "Segregationism has always been a popular position in Texas, and Theodore Bilbo has capitalized on this to make himself the new leader of Texas’s right wing. From small oil towns all the way to Austin, people are protesting about “communist infiltrators” at the highest levels of government, who seek to create something truly horrible: an equal society. While Communist infiltrators are unlikely, the conversion of our supporters to Bilbo’s banner is concerning."
tma.18.a:0 "We agree with you! Stop rioting!"
tma.19.t:0 "Ineffective Administration"
tma.19.d:0 "We had hoped we would be able to avoid this, but clearly we failed. It appears that we have totally lost the support of Texans, with their loyalties instead belonging to one of the myriad of rebel groups who seek to uproot our government. As if things weren’t bad enough, people are beginning to outright refuse to help us, and at this point you’re more likely to find an old woman harboring an enemy of the state than one who offers you a glass of lemonade."
tma.19.a:0 "Oh come on! Please?"
tma.20.t:0 "Business is Booming"
tma.20.d:0 "With all the chaos in the last few weeks, Garand’s sales are doing better than ever before. He is now, without a doubt, the wealthiest man in Texas, and he only stands to make more money as things get worse. Worse yet, his security forces have started patrolling the border with Texas, though they have yet to prevent anyone from crossing. Though he is a clear threat, he is not advocating for the overthrow of our state like others are, and he is therefore not our top priority. However, if we leave him alone, he may just sell our enemies the guns they use to kill us."
tma.20.a:0 "Surely he'll stop soon, right? Right?"
tma.21.t:0 "CMP Infiltrators in Government"
tma.21.d:0 "Our internal investigations regarding CMP infiltration in our government have all turned up exactly zero results. While this appears at first glance to be a miracle, upon deeper inspection, it is clear that even the investigators themselves are on the socialists’ payroll. We have no idea how deep this goes, but we know that their Revolution must be imminent."
tma.21.a:0 "The Red Rose of Texas?!"
tma.22.t:0 "Coughlin Loyalists in Government"
tma.22.d:0 "In Fr. Coughlin’s most recent radio sermon, he claimed that many top officers of the TMA had “seen the true light of the Lord God”, and were aiding him in his journey to create a theocratic state. While this type of bluster is common from Coughlin, we have reason to believe it is true. Despite his broadcasts being officially banned in all government buildings, the tin of his voice through the radio speaker is a near-constant sound from El Paso to Texarkana. Most importantly, Coughlin has been urging his listeners to raid arms depots, knowing that we don’t have the manpower to defend them all, and it’s clear that his Holy Insurrection is coming soon."
tma.22.a:0 "For Thine is the Kingdom."
tma.23.t:0 "Ranger Sympathizers"
tma.23.d:0 "Although the Rangers advocate for a Ranger-led state to ensure as little government as possible, the mere presence of a militarily-led state makes them similar enough to us in the minds of many. Because of this, many of our top officers have started to support Hamer over Gen. Walker, with some not even realizing that doing so is tantamount to treason. Across the state, the Rangers are increasingly “stopping robberies” at our arms warehouses, but curiously, the suspects always get away with the guns."
tma.23.a:0 "Cops and robbers, all of them!"
tma.24.t:0 "Bilboists Infiltrate Government"
tma.24.d:0 "Despite the fact that he is not even from Texas, Theodore Bilbo is undoubtedly one of, if not the, most powerful civilian politicians in Texas. Some sources claim that even General Walker himself has begun to consider that Bilbo might be right, and that much more serious action needs to be taken to preserve segregation if there is any hope for the Texan Military Administration to survive the next few months, let alone years."
tma.24.a:0 "Maybe he's got a point?"
tma.25.t:0 "Democratic Dominance"
tma.25.d:0 "The support for the Democrats in Texas has reached a fever pitch. Not a day goes by without protests across the state, and rumors abound that some of our top officers have become sympathetic to these ideals. What’s most concerning, however, is the fact that arms caches in areas supportive of the Democrats have started to go missing. Local quartermasters claim that they never received the arms in the first place, but manifests show they did."
tma.25.a:0 "This is really bad."
tma.26.t:0 "A Close Call"
tma.26.d:0 "The sun shone bright in the Texan sky, shining down on his audience. They had been waiting for hours, just to hear him speak. No man could attract a crowd like this in the sweltering Texan heat just to hear his opinions. No, like Aaron, Charles Coughlin had been imbued with the Voice of God, to warn the Texan people of their sins, and to urge them to repent before it was too late. For His cause was not a mission born of Earth, but a divine mission from Heaven, to create a new Texas, and a new America that could finally live up to the plans that the Lord had for it. Suitably prepared to fight for the Lord, Coughlin stepped out from behind the curtain and strode to his podium, meeting with uproarious applause.\n\n“Friends, do not applaud me. For I am just a humble servant of the Lord, here to-”\n\nCRACK!\n\nHe wasn’t quite sure what had happened. There was a loud noise, at first he thought it was microphone feedback, but he had heard that before, and this was different. Then he heard the gasp of the crowd. His shirt felt wet, and he looked down to see red staining his white shirt, starting from the shoulder. He looked down into the crowd, and saw a young man pointing a gun up at the stage. He gestured at him, and tried to say something, but all he managed to get out was “Son…”. He fell down, and everything went black.\n\nTwo weeks later, he was back on the radio."
tma.26.a:0 "The Armor of God stops any bullet."
tma.27.t:0 "Coughlin Declares Holy Insurrection!"
tma.27.d:0 "Father Charles Coughlin, long an advocate of an increased integration of Church and State, has taken the opportunity given by the brewing civil war to declare the creation of an “American Christian Commonwealth”. For the time being, the policy goals of this government seem to be “whatever Coughlin wants”, the calls for a religious struggle against the enemies of God has proven a siren song to many of the Texan populace, as Dallas swells with volunteers for Coughlin’s crusade."
tma.27.a:0 "So much for Christian pacifism."
tma.27.b:0 "To Arms! (Play as Dallas)"
tma.28.t:0 "Democratic Revolution!"
tma.28.d:0 "Houston was rocked by political instability today, as former Governor Miriam ‘Ma’ Ferguson declared the creation of the Second Texan Republic, attempting to preserve democracy and liberty in a land where so many intend to destroy it. Ferguson, having garnered her fair share of controversy as Governor, has promised to resign in favor of free elections as soon as democratic rule is restored to Texas, and many from Texas’s center, and even some moderate leftists, have flocked to Ferguson’s banner."

tma.28.b:0 "To Arms! (Play as Houston)"
tma.29.t:0 "Rangers Form Junta!"
tma.29.d:0 "From the Texas Rangers’ headquarters in Lubbock, TX, Ranger leader Frank Hamer declared that with the outbreak of violence between the various factions of Texan politics, the Texas Rangers will be forming a Provisional Ranger Militia, with the goal of establishing control over all of Texas, followed by a return to late 19th-century era government non-interference. The Rangers have won over many with their renown alone, but this philosophy of right wing libertarianism, as it's coming to be called, has won more than a few converts."
tma.29.a:0 "This just keeps getting worse and worse."
tma.29.b:0 "To Arms! (Play as Lubbock)"
tma.30.t:0 "Bilbo in Rebellion!"
tma.30.d:0 "Former Mississippi Senator Theodore Bilbo has declared the “rebirth of the Confederate States of America” from his home in Austin, and much of the surrounding area has flocked to his banner of segregation, national pride, and a restoration of the spirit, if not law, of the antebellum South. With our capitol now under the control of a rebel government, winning this war and reestablishing the TMA’s authority over all of Texas is a daunting task indeed."
tma.30.a:0 "Damn segregationists."
tma.30.b:0 "To Arms! (Play as Austin)"
tma.31.t:0 "The Crumbling State"
tma.31.d:0 "While the Second American Civil War ravaged its Northern neighbor, Mexico took advantage of the opportunity and began occupying neighboring American territories. As Mexican boots crossed the Rio Grande, Douglas MacArthur ordered the Southern Defense Command, led by George Patton, with Edwin Walker as his Second in Command, to stop the foreigners from capturing more American soil. Despite Patton's brave defense against the League of Nations' forces swarming against him  and Walker beating back Mexican troops in Texas, the combined overwhelming superiority of their enemies had split the Southern Defense Command in half along the Mississippi River. Knowing their defeat was inevitable, Patton and his men resorted to guerilla warfare, committed to destabilizing and destroying the Southern Mandate. Walker was left to manage a rump state in Texas with many internal factions vying for power, while the Mexican puppet of Tejas continued to be a humiliating reminder of Walker’s failure to kick them out. Sensing vulnerability, Father Charles Coughlin set up his own operations, citing Walker’s ineffective governance. In addition, democrats led by former Governor Miriam Ferguson are calling for a return to civil governance and elections. Popular across rural Texas, the Texas Rangers, led by Frank Hamer, demand a hands-off approach to governance and an Old West style of ruling. Lastly, the Dixiecrats who had fled from the occupied lands of the Southern Mandate have been pushing Walker to enact more segregationist policies. Although the Dixiecrats may be exploiting the local economy, Walker doesn’t necessarily disagree with their beliefs. Beyond the internal factions, Albuquerque and CMP holdouts in Tejas incite rebellions and unrest from time to time. With external and internal enemies encircling the Texas Military Administration, only time will tell if Walker can continue to hold on to power or if Texas will collapse once again into anarchy."
tma.31.a:0 "Instability breeds conflict."
tma.32.t:0 "Walker Abandons the Military Administration!"
tma.32.d:0 "The longtime commander of the Texan Military Administration, General Edwin Walker declared over the radio that the cause of the army in Texas was forsaken, and that all those who supported a return to true Americanism should join him in siding with Senator Theodore Bilbo, currently the acting President of the Confederate States of America. Seemingly jubilant at this announcement, Bilbo has resigned his position as acting President, instead requesting that General Walker take up a similar role in this new government, though with the stipulation that he step down in favor of Bilbo’s return once the Texan Civil War was over. The rump administration of the TMA was not at all prepared for the departure of the only man to ever be their commander, but one of Walker’s close advisors, Army Air General Claire Lee Chennault has stepped in to fill the power vacuum."
tma.32.a:0 "Even Walker sees it's a failed state."
tma.33.t:0 "Acadia Declares Independence!"
tma.33.d:0 "Paul N. Cyr, former Lieutant Governor of (in)famous Louisiana politican Huey Long, has declared the birth of the state of Acadiana today in Lafayette, LA. Seeking to avoid the blooshed of the coming Texan Civil War, many otherwise apolitical citizens have declared support for Cyr's government, giving it a much-needed boost of legitimacy. Appealing to a sense of Louisianan exceptionalism and an ephasis on the French-influenced Louisianan culture, this new Acadianan state represents something that hasn't truly been seen since before the sale of the Louisiana territory."
