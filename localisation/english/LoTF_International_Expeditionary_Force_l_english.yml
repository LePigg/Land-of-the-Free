 IEF.4.a:0 "Great work all around"
 IEF.5.t:0 "Gloryless"
 IEF.5.d:0 "On the eve of the Second American Civil War, Walter Bedell Smith had expressed feelings of loyalty towards the Federalist Movement, enlisting in the Southern Defense Command under George S. Patton. The south was an insurgent filled battlefield, and Walter frequently fought against Socialist partisan attacks throughout Dixie. Under the constant threat of socialist insurgent strikes, ruthless measures had to be taken against the civilians within insurgent areas, only dampening the morale of Federal troops. Eventually, the East Coast intervention by the League began, with eventual Federal declaration of war upon them. Walter had been sent to defend the flank of the Federal forces of Virginia, but despite their best efforts, were pushed back by the League. Walter retreated, a broken man, to when he met Charles Lindbergh. Lindbergh had recently formed a “veterans association” of former Federalist troops who were fighting against the League occupation. Walter agreed to join them, and advance towards the Great Lakes. However, as the campaign advanced, Walter learned the true nature of the organization. The Patriotic Legion of America, as it was called, was an ultranationalist organization, built upon militarism and violence. On their campaigns, mass repressions and executions against the civilian population under their fear of communism and foreigners soon left Walter disgusted. He defected after a horrific pogrom in Cincinnati, running towards the frontline with the League accompanied by his few loyal units. He realized he had to make a deal with the devil, as the Patriotic Legion to him was the greater threat to America. He notified the British commander of the Kentucky campaign, Roy Urquhart, of the Legionary plans to destroy the League and establish an ultranationalist state in Indiana. Now backed by League forces, the now “Traitor General” Walter launched an attack into the Legion’s command centers, eventually managing to destroy their remaining forces in the invasion. However, Lindbergh was nowhere to be found, and the decision to proclaim victory would come back to bite the occupation authority. In honor of his collaboration, the League appointed Walter as the governor general of Indiana and Illinois, hoping that he could eventually turn the states over to the League to expand the mandates. But this ideal was short lived, as the people of the two states began to openly resist the League’s authority, and rumors continue to circulate that Lindbergh is planning his revenge to topple Walter once and for all."
 IEF.5.a:0 "This path will not be easy."
 IEF.6.t:0 "All We Need"
 IEF.6.d:0 "Our efforts to deal with the mounting dissent have appeared no different from the Socialist insurgencies during the Civil War, as terrorism and other violent acts threaten our state. Recently, we have requested the League to provide further assistance in counterinsurgency measures with increased reinforcements and equipment, as it is becoming increasingly clear that the survival of our regime falls upon League assistance, but such clear dependence on them might only further weaken the legitimacy of our regime."
 IEF.6.a:0 "We need their continued patronage."
 IEF.6.b:0 "We can handle this ourselves!"
 IEF.7.t:0 "A Critical Affair"
 IEF.7.d:0 "It’s no secret, morale within the ranks and populace is critically low. Although we have tried to improve our image, we are still seen as collaborators with those who wish to see America mutilated and shamed. In order to paint a better image of the League army, Walter B. Smith has announced a public speech in Indiana, an area still suspected to be harboring secessionist sentiment. Should the speech go through, Walter might be able to convert some of the people there to his cause, and secure the loyalty of the local garrisons. But due to the nature of the area, there have been rumors of a plot to kill Walter upon his arrival. Security must be increased, but will it suffice?"
 IEF.7.a:0 "It's too risky..."
 IEF.7.b:0 "This must be done!"
 IEF.8.t:0 "The Underground State"
 IEF.8.d:0 "The state of our forces has been questionable lately. Weapons have gone missing over the past few months, as caches appear to be looted. We have tried installing more patrols across the military depots, but the looting hasn’t stopped. Smith suspects treason is the culprit here, and has been ordering the investigation of officers that have been acting suspiciously over the recent months. Leland Hobbs was put in charge of the effort, and after a 2 week long investigation he determined that…"
 IEF.8.a:0 "There has been a network of weapon traffickers in the ranks!"
 IEF.8.b:0 "Nothing is going on here."
 IEF.9.t:0 "The Collapse"
 IEF.9.d:0 "Lindbergh crawled across the floor. The capitol building of Indy had been shelled by the International Armies, leveling it to the ground. Lindbergh had nearly escaped, but a direct hit on the building near him knocked him to the floor, crippling his legs. Gerald had not been seen for days; like the coward he was, he fled deep into Kentucky with a KKK escort, leaving his fellow fascists to die alone. Now Lindbergh was one of them, slowly succumbing to his wounds. As he continued to drag himself through the wreckage, he saw a faint figure of what appeared to be a man wearing a brodie helmet. “Please… don’t leave me here. I’ll stand trial. Just don’t let me die like this…” Lindbergh mumbled. The man perhaps responded, but it all sounded like gibberish. He heard the sound of boots marching, as the blurry figure of a man continued to move away. “Please!” he coughed up blood. “I’ll plead guilty! Don’t… leave… me here…”. Lindbergh’s consciousness began to fade. The drums of war fell silent."
 IEF.9.a:0 "One less loose end."
 IEF.10.t:0 "Dealing with the Former Patriots"
 IEF.10.d:0 "With the execution of Lindbergh and Gerald’s escape into the south, the generals of the Legion were quick to cease resistance and have all been detained. Walter B. Smith arrived in the state prison of Indiana, where the former traitors have been held. With his arrival, the demeanor of the convicts soon turned into one of pleading. The price of treason was death, and they did not wish to meet the same fate as Lindbergh. Smith looked them in the eyes; he had once been one of them, hypnotized by the words of the fascists, and he wondered if they could give up their ways just as he did. But at the same time, they had made their choice when the 2nd rebellion arrived as to who they were loyal to. Although they claimed to be either unaware or forced to comply, the numerous crimes of the Legion were facilitated by their officers, allowing their men to terrorize civilians and prisoners of war. The next choice is a hard one: we can either convict them as the war criminals they are, serving justice to all their victims as well as complying with the League of Nation’s request, or Walter could have some sympathy. They will be allowed to either revive a discharge from the army and be forced to civilian life, or even be allowed to rejoin our ranks. Although they are war criminals, allowing them mercy would not only help reconcile the people of Indiana but also give Walter more legitimacy."
 IEF.10.a:0 "Line them up against the wall."
 IEF.10.b:0 "They deserve a second chance."
 IEF.11.t:0 "The Ones left Behind"
 IEF.11.d:0 "With the end of the war, the people of Indiana are in great distress. The legionaries burned and destroyed much of the city, and were quick to clamp down on any dissent to the war. Many are homeless and without anything, along with many disgruntled veterans of the Indianapolis home guard. Not to mention the several minority groups in the city that were ruthlessly targeted by paramilitary attacks. The state budget is quite small, but the League is willing to offer us loans to help repair the damaged state. We will attempt to help as many people as we can, but it will be costly and not without lots of international aid. Walter on the other hand has devised a much cheaper plan that would minimize international presence. He plans to prioritize the needs of Anglo Americans, which consist of a larger amount of the population, as well as appeasing those with legionary sympathies. This will leave many of the African Americans and other minority groups to fend for their own, but it’s surely a small price?"
 IEF.11.a:0 "Request international aid."
 IEF.11.b:0 "Slash the budget."
 IEF.12.t:0 "Going Dark"
 IEF.12.d:0 "As Walter prepares his men to make moves to finally expel the League from the Great Lakes, the British delegation has mysteriously gone off the radar. Urquhart was not found in his office and British troops have seemingly left the state. Although their presence is waning, this might not be a good sign."
 IEF.12.a:0 "A sense a calm before the storm."
 IEF.13.t:0 "Security Measures"
 IEF.13.d:0 "The disappearance of Urquhart has caused some unease within our command. Many fear that without the British we may become victims of a second Legionary uprising. Although Walter firmly believes the fascist threat is gone, his inner circle believes Legionary sympathizers may conspire to assassinate him and overthrow our state. On the day of his address to the public, we may have to increase security measures, but is this just paranoia?"
 IEF.13.a:0 "Lindbergh is long gone, his cronies are of no threat to us."
 IEF.13.b:0 "We cannot truly be safe until we know for sure that they're dead!"
 IEF.14.t:0 "The Question of Martial Law"
 IEF.14.d:0 "As the days move ever closer to the grand speech, the communications in the south have completely vanished. We have sent telegrams to the local government in Kentucky but with no response. By each day the possibility of another rebellion grows. Walter has been approached by his officer clique to declare nationwide martial law. Although the army rules the country, local governance is handled by local politicians, but in these trying times we may have no choice but to replace them with military governors."
 IEF.14.a:0 "We need order, now!"
 IEF.14.b:0 "This will only worsen the situation!"
 IEF.15.t:0 "Sudden Message"
 IEF.15.d:0 "Out of the blue, contact with Britain via radio has been restored. Our comms in the south are still silent and the threat of a second resurgence of the Legionaries has scared many, but it appears the British have confirmed this. Britain has noted that multiple insurgent cells have appeared south and fascist sympathizers plan to assassinate Walter during his speech. Many have taken this as a sign to call off the speech, but Walter is skeptical. The British have urged Walter to focus his army south to crush the insurgents, and promise to send aid to the cities to stop any incursions. Walter however, believes this is impossible to believe. Could’ve the British gotten ahold of Walter’s plans to declare independence and plot to sabotage him?"
 IEF.15.a:0 "We must turn this rebellion stillborn!"
 IEF.15.b:0 "Committing our forces is foolish."
 IEF.16.t:0 "Intervention"
 IEF.16.d:0 "The day of the speech arrived. Thousands arrived in Springfield to listen to Walter’s address of independence. But as soon as the speech began, sounds of gunfire rang throughout the streets. The crowd dispersed, and it turns out a detachment of British forces had begun an invasion of the city. Walter knew that the British could not be trusted, and he interrupted his speech to take command of the local national guard. The British assault lasted 3 hours, but they could not breach the cities’ defenses. After heavy casualties, a reorganized American force launched a counterattack, driving the British back and chasing them out of their southern command centers. The British retreated into Kentucky, and after this stunning victory, we have earned our freedom."
 IEF.16.a:0 "We have made the founding fathers proud."
 IEF.17.t:0 "Intervention"
 IEF.17.d:0 "The day of the speech arrived. Thousands arrived in Springfield to listen to Walter’s address of independence. But as soon as the speech began, sounds of gunfire rang throughout the streets. The crowd dispersed, and a whole division of British forces stormed the area. Walter rallied a few guards to defend himself, but they were quickly overran and surrendered. Walter attempted to flee the scene, but as he ran out the building he ran into a detachment led by Urquhart. “Stand down, if you know what’s good for ya!” yelled Urquhart, gun aimed at Smith’s head. Smith reached for his gun to place it on the ground, but his movement caused Roy to discharge a single round at his forehead. As Smith’s body hit the floor, the last thing to cross his mind was…"
 IEF.17.a:0 "Im sorry Columbia, I have failed you." 
 IEF.18.t:0 "A Meeting with an Old Friend"
 IEF.18.d:0 "After a tip off to Eisenhower to meet Smith at the border, a secret escort moved the two generals to an undisclosed location to discuss terms of cooperation. Smith had been an early associate of Eisenhower, who knew he was a talented individual, but the main purpose for the meeting was the reasons behind Walter’s defection to the League. Walter argued that he felt that MacArthur’s commitment to democracy was little more than a sham, and cited his willingness to cooperate with extremists like Lindbergh as a warning of his true intentions. Despite his claims, Eisenhower wasn’t fully convinced of the true nature of Smith’s collaboration, considering his former membership in Lindbergh’s Legion, but at the same time he trusted Walter, and deep down Walter’s words resonated with him. In the end, Eisenhower decides…"
 IEF.18.a:0 "“We will return democracy together.”"
 IEF.18.b:0 "“I can’t work with a traitor.”"
 IEF.19.t:0 "A Stab in the Back"
 IEF.19.d:0 "The meeting with Eisenhower was a failure; despite the men’s former bonds, Eisenhower chose to look the other way. Either because he distrusted Walter’s true intentions or he was following orders from MacArthur, we are now isolated. We are now forced to cooperate with the League of Nations once more if we aren’t to be torn apart by the Northern Warlords alone…"
 IEF.19.a:0 "Left alone with the wolves..."
 IEF.20.t:0 "The Proposal"
 IEF.20.d:0 "With the Socialist threat finally destroyed, Eisenhower felt that it was his turn to fulfill his promise to Smith. After all, it was his true goal all along: after the true threat to American principles was destroyed, the state of emergency allowing the Federalist junta to rule could finally be ended. Eisenhower and a few loyalist congressmen arranged a meeting with MacArthur. The conditions were simple: MacArthur was to step down as “provisional president” to begin the return to American democracy. However, many within the army were beginning to become drunk with power, and as MacArthur’s ego continued to outpace his commitment to restoing democracy, there was always the threat of breaking his promises and declaring himself president for life. It was a risky move, but one that Ike felt he had to make…"
 IEF.20.a:0 "MacArthur steps down."
 IEF.20.b:0 "Ike's soft coup is foiled."
 IEF.21.t:0 "The Gamble Pays Off"
 IEF.21.d:0 "MacArthur, the tyrant that caused us to be forced to work with the League to begin with, has somehow been “convinced” to step down as acting president of the Eastern Federals, allowing Eisenhower to take over and begin the return to democracy. With this new development, the need for our expedition has expired, and Smith plans to rejoin the one true republic."
 IEF.21.a:0 "God bless America."
 IEF.22.t:0 "The Death of Democracy"
 IEF.22.d:0 "Eisenhower’s coup has failed, and he has been detained by MacArthur’s cronies. It was to be expected: the tyrant has shown his true face and thrown off the facade that he cared about democracy. Now it is our turn to carry the torch, and we must destroy this clique of egotistical despots!"
 IEF.22.a:0 "To hell with these demagogues!"
 IEF.23.t:0 "Capturing Norman"
 IEF.23.d:0 "The original intent of the British intervention in America was to prevent the victory of Norman’s socialists and detain him, but with his evacuation to Chicago, his long awaited trial was stopped. However, after our brutal campaign against his Red Guards, we have broken into his Oval Office and successfully captured him. Although it would be nice to hold the trial ourselves, we must delegate justice to our allies in Washington to finally complete the League’s original goal."
 IEF.23.a:0 "Washington will be pleased, that's for sure!"
 IEF.24.t:0 "The Trial of Norman Thomas"
 IEF.24.d:0 ""
 IEF.24.a:0 "The price for treason is death!"
 IEF.24.b:0 "Life imprisonment!"
 IEF.25.t:0 "For Our Republic"
 IEF.25.d:0 "Clark had been visited at the local cell by Smith himself. Shortly captured after the fall of his “royal palace” he surrendered himself to our armies. Smith had an analytical mind: something about Clark’s ramblings about an American monarchy seemed… insincere. When questioned about it, Mark gave vague answers at first before saying, “they just needed a hero to stand behind. If a king is what it took, so be it.” Clark was then scheduled to be transferred to a mental institution."
 IEF.25.a:0 "Let us put an end to this farce."
 IEF.26.t:0 "The Arrest of MacArthur"
 IEF.26.d:0 "MacArthur had once accepted the British intervention in the civil war as a welcome surprise, but with the occupation of the Eastern cities and formation of the DC regime, MacArthur saw it nothing more as a stab in the back and declared war. Although the goal continued to remain as the “destruction of Bolshevism in America”, the arrest of MacArthur soon became a secondary goal. With the tyrant in our hands, we will now turn him over to the League to face long awaited justice."
 IEF.26.a:0 "Thus to all tyrants!"

 IEF.27.d:0 ""
 IEF.27.a:0 "A nice prison cell is waiting for him."
 IEF.28.t:0 "A Second Shot at Salvation"
 IEF.28.d:0 "After the complicated affair in Erie, Eisenhower has once more been approached by Smith. This time, not for cooperation but as a threat. The remnants of the Federal are to surrender “in the name of democracy”, but seeing how swiftly he was to openly work with the East Coast traitors and crush localized dissent, this ideal seems less promising."
 IEF.28.a:0 "I concede in the name of democracy."
